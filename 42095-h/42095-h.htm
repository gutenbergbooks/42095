<p>Many a trumpet sounded forth the bold advance, and many a drum beat to
arms, and full many a heart throbbed high, upon the morning of the ever
memorable first of July, 1690. Then burst forth the signal-gun that
loudly pealed forth the approach of day, re-echoed by the woods and
waters of the Boyne. This signal was to announce to the troops of the
Prince of Orange instantly to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> commence their march as soon as summoned
by the cannon's roar. Their march was about three miles distant from the
margin of that stream which on this day was destined to become the
rubicon of empire!</p>

<p>The plan of attack, upon the part of the Prince of Orange, consisted of
three parts. We shall now begin with the first:&mdash;Count Menard Schomberg
(the son of Field Marshal Duke of Schomberg, and Commander-in-Chief
under the Prince of Orange) was to lead on the right wing towards the
westward of some fords which adjoined the bridge of Slane; the force
consisted chiefly of cavalry, and amounted to ten thousand men; Count
Schomberg commanded the cavalry, and Lieutenant General Douglas the
infantry. Their route to the ford, which it had been determined they
were to pass, lay through an unenclosed country, the grounds of which
were partly covered with low brush-wood, over which the horses sprung
with delight; and had the soldiers been clad in green a spectator might
have imagined he looked down on a hunting party, instead of beholding <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
an army upon the burst of battle; for, startled and roused from their
peaceful lair, numerous rabbits and hares were seen to jump forth from
beneath underwood, furze, fern, and heath; which soon set the soldiery
at fault, and who for the moment gave up (tumultuously dashing into the
merry greenwood) the hunting of men for chase of the leporine tribe; and
they were not brought back to a sense of duty until thrice the bugle of
recall had sounded; when having knocked on the head some hundreds of
these peaceful, harmless animals, the troops gave up the chase, which is
the symbol, for the dire reality of war.</p>

<p>They had now arrived on the margin of the Boyne, and upon the opposite
banks were entrenched King James and his army, consisting of English,
Scotch, Irish, and French troops. The latter were the experienced
veterans of Louis the Fourteenth, who had toiled and conquered in many a
desperate conflict.</p>

<p>The camp of King James was stationed thus:&mdash;On its right was the city of
Drogheda, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> filled with Irish soldiers: upon the further banks of the
Boyne, and to the eastward, their tents were extended in two parallel
lines, and protected by a deep morass, and on the left it was difficult
to be passed. In front of the camp were the fords of the Boyne deep and
dangerous, protected by rugged banks, and defended by some breast-works;
while the huts and hedges were lined with infantry on the rere; and at
some distance arose the church and village of Donore, upon whose
commanding heights King James in person was stationed. Three miles
further onward was the pass of Duleek, on which King James firmly
depended for a retreat, if such should be found wanting. The works
thrown up for the defence of the camp were strong, and well fortified in
front by the broad and deep waters of the Boyne; while the ditch, or
fosse, defending this position, was deep, and flanked with redoubts,
batteries, and pallisadoes.</p>

<p>The batteries of James kept up a brisk fire, pouring forth cannon-shot
upon the assailants, and not without due effect. This was to awe <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the troops of Count Menard Schomberg, and incapacitate them from fording
the river. But it was not long erewhile that this deep salutation from
the cannon's mouth was duly responded to, and with correspondent effect,
by Count Schomberg, who, advancing to the margin of the ford, planted on
the spot three twenty-four pounders, which instantly commenced to fire
upon the enemy's intrenchments. This was soon again answered on their
part by five field-pieces returning the cannonade, which General
Sarsfield had mounted on his batteries. However, after an hour's heavy
and destructive cannonade, the superior weight of metal and calibre
irresistibly carried its expected success. Several of the French and
Irish artillery were killed; guns might then be seen dismounted, some
with their wheels broken, and others hurled from their carriages, all
thus rendered useless. Count Schomberg thus witnessing their batteries
to be effectually silenced, gave the signal for fording the Boyne; and
boldly and promptly dashed first onward at the head of his squadron, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>trumpets, drums, and kettle-drums, and all the accompanying
bands, striking forth their martial music, to which the waters of the
Boyne re-echoed. This was of course to encourage and arouse the ardour
of his troops, who, with a firm unbroken front, dashed impetuously into
the stream, as though it had been their natural element. The waters were
indeed deep, the infantry found them breast-high, and were compelled to
carry their muskets above their heads, to preserve them dry and fit for
service; while the horses of the cavalry were forced in many instances
to swim, the current of the river having been stopped by this sudden and
mighty influx of men and horses, which, as might have been expected,
raised the waters of the Boyne to an unusual height. In the mean time a
large squadron of infantry arrived on the opposite bank, who kept up a
galling fire, at which time some of the cavalry of King James plunged
into the stream to oppose the landing of the troops of the Prince of
Orange. It then became uproar, noise, and confusion, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>all the
while death was busy on the Boyne, and upon its opposite banks.</p>

<p class="center">"Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan!"</p>

<p>With the loss of many wounded, and in a greater ratio of others who were
slain, Count Menard Schomberg effected the landing of his troops; at
which time the dragoons of King James began incontinently to retreat
towards the main body, which was attended with very considerable loss.
The main body of King James's infantry was extended in two parallel
lines. Lieutenant General Douglas finding how matters stood, sent
promptly for a reinforcement of foot to extend his lines in a similar
manner; but this intention was impeded by the intervention of an
extensive bog to his left, which rendered it quite impossible for his
cavalry to pass; he therefore ordered them to defile to the right, and
the infantry to march in open column to the left, and then to pass the
bog, or morass, in single files. This passage of the troops was effected
below the bridge of Slane. And having now dispersed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>the troops which
opposed him, his object was to force his way to the ford of Duleek, so
that at once he might attack the enemy from behind, and totally cut off
his retreat at the same moment. King James perceiving Count Schomberg to
march for Slane, and great bodies of troops moving with him, concluded
that the whole army were taking the same route; and that the English and
Dutch troops, conscious of the difficulty of forcing the fords between
the camps, would not, thus circumstanced, dare to attempt them,
discouraged, as well they might be, from an expected attack on their
flank, in such an enterprise. However, should they attempt, and succeed,
he apprehended that his communication with Duleek might in the mean time
be cut off. Accordingly, under this full impression, King James sent
forward a great force to watch Count Schomberg, and by his doing so he
weakened his principal force. The Count Schomberg, in consequence of
these improvident movements of his opponent, found but little opposition
to his ulterior passage of the ford, soon dispersing the few troops
which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>had soonest arrived to oppose him; and then he dashed on with his
infantry, and boldly floundered through the bog; while he sent his
cavalry round over a narrow tract of firm ground. The boldness of which
action completely discouraged his opponents; in consequence of which
they rapidly retreated to Duleek.</p>

<p>We are now come to the <i>second</i> part of the attack, as devised and
planned by the Prince of Orange. The moment that the prince was informed
that Count Schomberg had passed the ford, and had accomplished the
landing of his troops, although his Highness had long been quite
prepared to ford the river, yet the information which he received of the
complete success of Count Schomberg increased his desire to commence the
march, which he instantly began. He was attended by Duke Schomberg, who
was to command the centre of the army. The Dutch Guards, in their blue
jackets and orange facings, first plunged into the waters of the Boyne.
The Brandenburghers at the same instant, impelled by national
competition, dashed also simultaneously into the stream, led on by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
their gallant colonel.</p>

<p>The Dutch Guards, who thus led on the van of battle, were broadly
exposed to the fire of their enemies, whose lines were intrenched along
the opposite heights of the Boyne, and also by several battalions
stationed upon the banks beneath. These troops of King James not only
resisted on the banks, but plunging into the stream, manfully opposed
the approach of the infantry of the Prince of Orange. But the troops of
his Highness, even while in the river, fired a grand discharge of
musketry, which instantaneously checked their opponents. Here a
chivalrous combat for the standard of green Erin, fought for in the very
bosom of the Boyne, is worthy of being recorded, while</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">"Advanced&mdash;forced back, now low, now high,</div>
   <div class="verse">The pennon sunk and rose." <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The standard of the golden harp was borne by Cornet Hamilton, nephew to
Major <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>General Hamilton, and an officer in the General's regiment of
horse. The combat for the armorial banner was sustained by a brave
officer of the Brandenburghers, who seemed determined at every risk to
possess the standard, and place it as a trophy at the feet of the Prince
of Orange. The conflict was fought with desperate fury; they fought in
the flood&mdash;they fought at the ford; they next landed on the banks, and
fought upon the verdant shores of the Boyne. Here Hamilton, dreading to
lose the banner he had so gallantly defended, tore the banner from the
standard-staff, (it was the work of only a moment,) and instantly wrapped
the banner around his body, while with earnest enthusiasm he
exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">By death alone shall Erin's harp be won,</div>
   <div class="verse">And through the life-blood of her faithful son!</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The dreadful personal combat now recommenced, and in the fierce and
astounding shock of the charge, the sword of Hamilton was shivered in
twain; and within the same <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>moment, from the overpowering shock and
impetus of the charge, both the combatants instantaneously were flung,
horse and rider, to the ground. They now arose upon equal terms, for
both were disarmed; but still they met, while each with daring
desperation contended for the prize; foot opposed to foot, knee to knee,
and arm to arm! For some time they strenuously contended with doubtful
success; but soon the Brandenburgh officer was upon the point of
success, when Cornet Hamilton, with deep determined desperation, aided
by bodily strength, instantly seized upon the Brandenburgher, and with
all resistless force plunged himself and his adversary into the waters
of the Boyne, from whence neither ever more were seen to rise! And it
was horrifying to hear the splash of the gurgling waters into which the
brave combatants, fighting with an unsubduable valour, sunk entombed,
never more to rise! and this amid the applauding shouts, or rather
shrieks, of either contending army, who had meantime given a pause to
the battle; while intently gazed both friend and foe, with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>wonder, awe,
and admiration, upon such a determined deadly feat of chivalry! seldom
equalled, and probably never surpassed, neither in the annals of war,
nor amid the feats and fictions of chivalry!</p>

<p>The Duke of Tyrconnel gallantly headed and led on his own regiment of
dragoon guards in headlong charge, with signal bravery, and not without
due effect. At length, however, the duke was repulsed, and his charger
which he rode was shot dead, and fell with his manly master to the
ground. However, he was soon seen mounted again, having arisen without
hurt from the earth, and briskly vaulted on a led horse of his own,
which was conducted instantly to him by his groom from the rere of the
regiment. The Irish troops were, at this period of the battle, thrown
into some confusion, and compelled unwillingly to retire. But the duke
conducted the retreat in a masterly and gallant manner. Soon after this
the English and Danish troops, with the brigades of Sir John Hanmer and
Melion&eacute;re, immediately followed, and passed the ford without
opposition. The cause assigned for this disposition of the forces was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
this:&mdash;that the Prince of Orange well knew that both the Dutch and
Brandenburghers were warmly attached to his person, and he felt
convinced that the Huguenots and Enniskilliners were as deeply attached
to their religion. But the Danes at that time he did not as yet
sufficiently know; and much he feared to oppose the English forces who
now supported the princely James, their lawful sovereign, and who had
formerly commanded them, as now he did, in person.</p>

<p>Field Marshal Duke of Schomberg, who was most anxious, yet at the same
time doubtful of success, thinking the attempt a desperate one, still
firmly retained his station, surrounded by a strong body of troops, in
order to yield assistance wherever most it was wanted. The French troops
of King James now seemed to start from the earth, for hitherto they had
remained undiscovered; but now they arose upon the sight from among the
little hills, appearing far more numerous than what they really were.
This deception <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>arose from the circumstance of their gradually, and at
intervals, arising to view from the brush-wood, thickets, and ditches,
where they lay stationed; and furthermore from the extension of their
ranks, from the interposition of trees, walls, and hedges, and the
intervention of houses, hamlets, and other objects, which had hitherto
obscured them.</p>

<p>Major General Hamilton, at the head of his own regiment of dragoons,
made a truly gallant charge, while fiercely he attacked the squadron of
the Danes, and withal with such vigour and success, that they soon fled
back incontinently through the river. Hamilton's cavalry, and that of
the Count de Lauzun, meanwhile pursued them, and having briskly chased
them, but without effect, as soon they returned, and then fell furiously
upon the French Huguenots, who having no pikes to sustain the dreadful
charge, their ranks of infantry were instantly broken through. Here
suddenly the cry arising of "<i>horse! horse!</i>" (of which to support them
they were in great want) having been mistaken for "<i>halt! halt!</i>" still
further threw the centre of the squadron <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>of the Prince of Orange into
great disorder. The Dutch?&mdash;They <i>halted</i> indeed, and with a vengeance.
The Huguenot ranks were broken through, while slowly the English succour
advanced; and the Danes, without even waiting to be attacked, wheeled
somewhat precipitately "right about," then fled panic-struck, and
plunged into the Boyne to effect a retreat. Not slow, however, were some
companies of Hamilton's dragoons to pursue, who promptly dashed into the
river to cut off a retreat.</p>

<p>At this point of the battle, the brave, the intrepid Callimot&eacute;, who in
person commanded his valiant corps of Huguenots&mdash;he who had been the
faithful partner of the toils and victories, and partaker of the glories
of Schomberg in former battles&mdash;at this moment was cut down by one of
Hamilton's horse. He had indeed received a mortal wound! He fell, but
was soon upraised by his brave soldiers; and while they bore him away,
bleeding even to death, in their arms, still strong and deep in agony
was heard the hero's voice. He called aloud to his brave companions in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the battle, "<i>A la gloire, mes enfans&mdash;&aacute; la gloire!</i>" and while thus
exclaiming, he died in the arms of his valiant comrades! Thus nobly sunk
this valiant man. He died a hero, and fell as the brave should fall,
shouting even in death the cry of victory! Meanwhile Duke Schomberg was
distinctly seen spurring onward his noble charger even in the deepest
part of the Boyne, encouraging and calling aloud upon the Huguenots to
rally, and accompanying this with his gesture, his voice, and his sword.
His strenuous and manly exertions were beheld and heard in vain, for no
succour advanced!</p>

<p>Hamilton's cavalry, a second time breaking through the ranks of the
flying Huguenots, wounded Duke Schomberg in the engagement, and hurried
him along; when his own troops firing at the duke through mistake, he
fell lifeless from his war-horse.</p>

<p>Hamilton's terrific charge on the part of the Irish, and the relief
brought to reinforce the Duke of Schomberg's squadron, on the other,
gave time to both sides to rally, and prepare for a renewed engagement.
The Duke of Tyrconnel performed prodigies of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>valour. He here had a
second horse shot under him while sustaining this dreadful conflict.</p>

<p>We must now come to the <i>third</i> part of the battle, as it was arranged
(as we have before premised) by the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>During the two former attacks every where was to be seen the blue and
orange plumes of Nassau waving over flood and field! Now also every
where was he to be seen quickly to rush into danger, riding rapidly from
place to place, examining every regiment and troop, exhorting and
inspiring them by look, gesture, and action. The soldiers were well
pleased at this attention; they were flattered and animated, every man
considering himself under the immediate inspection of his royal leader,
while every motion and man&oelig;uvre his counsel, conduct, and courage
directed.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange led on the left wing of the army, accompanied by
Prince George of Denmark, and they passed the Boyne at the ford of Old
Bridge, between the army of James and the town of Drogheda; and it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>not without difficulty that this measure was accomplished. Here the
charger of the Prince of Orange got entangled in a bog or morass at the
other side of the river, where he had landed, and where he was forced to
alight until one of the royal attendants succeeded in extricating
"Sorrel" (for so was the royal charger named) from his entanglement in
the morass, and assisted the prince to remount.</p>

<p>As soon as all the troops had passed over the Boyne water, and were put
in some order, the Prince of Orange commanded them to march; and
constantly was he seen upon the alert, with his large conspicuous
triangular hat and nodding plumes, urging "Sorrel" in full gallop at the
head of his cavalry, his sword drawn, and his wounded arm freed from the
scarf which had supported it. He waved his sword on high, and encouraged
and inflamed the soldiery to battle.</p>

<p>At this sight the troops of King James manifested a disposition to
retreat. King James, however, endeavoured by every method and persuasion
he could use to rally his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>men, while loudly he repeatedly called out to
them,</p>

<p class="center">"On, on ye brave!"</p>

<p>while to his general officers he expressed his fixed determination "to
make a bold and resolute effort for the recovery of his throne; for
<i>that all the hopes of his restoration depended upon the result of that
day</i>!"</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange now despatched twelve battalions and nine squadrons
to strengthen his right wing, and placed himself at the head of the left
wing of his army. The right, as we have before observed, was commanded
by Count Menard Schomberg; the centre by Field-Marshal Duke of
Schomberg, and the left by William.</p>

<p>In the meantime all the forces of King James, except the detachment
which had retired to Duleek, promptly gathered from all quarters, and
formed a firm and formidable phalanx around their king. Here the battle
raged loud and stormy, but with various success, for about an hour,
representing both to the eye and ear all the horrors of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>civil and
foreign war commingled. Here waved in the breeze the silver lilies of
France; there undulated the silver harp of Erin, the golden lion of old
merry England; and the Scottish unicorn, with the bordure of the
thistle; next the Belgic lion in refulgent gold; then the dark, black
eagle of Brandenburgh, with the ominous raven of Denmark, all waving in
the morning breeze, and in the fierce discordant attack shaken to and
fro, like the woods of some ancient forest. Here, and every where,
resounded the languages of France, England, Holland, Denmark, Germany,
and Ireland&mdash;all spoken promiscuously. May we then not observe, what a
scene was there combined! withal the various and varied nations, their
troops' uniforms consisting of various and discordant hues, all
combining and forming the different tints of the rainbow, including many
<i>ultra</i> and even <i>plus-ultra</i> dyes of the arc of heaven!&mdash;green, blue,
black, yellow, scarlet, and some undefinable colours. The varied look
that caught the eye, and the varied language that irresistibly reached
the ear, rendered <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>this ever most remarkable battle-scene truly another
Babel! While Frenchmen fought against their fellow-subjects in some
quarters of the field&mdash;while in others brave Britons contended against
Britons&mdash;and, alas! the sons of unhappy Ireland fought against each
other in opposing ranks!&mdash;Oh, the reflection was dreadful!</p>

<p>At this period of the battle Tyrconnel defeated the English, who were
commanded by General De Ginckle, and who thereupon suddenly retreated.
The Prince of Orange, perceiving what Tyrconnel had done, rallied the
English cavalry, and remonstrated with them upon their flight. When thus
urged, they rushed again upon the charge, and not without some success.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange brought up his Dutch cavalry and the Enniskilliners
to support the charge; his Highness then wheeled to the left, and the
Enniskilliners, through mistake, did the same. Upon this the prince
galloped furiously to the right, and drew up his Dutch troops. The
Enniskilliners upon this became conscious of the mistake which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>they
involuntarily had committed, and they instantly reoccupied their ground,
and fought resolutely.</p>

<p>At this momentous crisis of the battle, the brave Tyrconnel strained
every nerve to support the troops under his command. He galloped in
front, and from flank to rere, while every where he exhorted,
encouraged, and animated the troops, as onward he galloped through the
ranks.</p>

<p>Here Tyrconnel encountered the Brandenburgh cavalry, with their gallant
colonel at their head, who, not unobserved by Tyrconnel, throughout that
well-fought field performed prodigies of valour. The duke and colonel
met, and closed in single combat, managing the broad sword with
equal&mdash;nay, with consummate skill; when a private of the
Brandenburghers, perceiving that the duke had the advantage of his
leader, presently level <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ling his carbine, and aiming at Tyrconnel, he
suddenly fired it off. The duke escaped, but his noble charger fell, and
flung with tremendous force to the earth the hero whom he had borne. In
an instant the colonel was on his feet, and raised his gallant opponent
in his arms.</p>

<p>"Brave and truly noble colonel! accept my warm and grateful thanks for
this truly generous and heroic act; and permit me, at the same time, to
know to whom I am so much, so highly indebted?"</p>

<p>"Noble duke," rejoined the valiant stranger, "for such I know you to be,
indeed you much overrate my service. However, at some future time, more
propitious than the present, my name shall be divulged to you; at the
present moment I have reasons quite sufficient to cause me to decline
the explanation which you require. But you shall have two pledges, and
from a true knight, for the fulfilment of my promise, solemnly made in
the battle-field!"</p>

<p>He then loudly called to his equery: "Ho! Malcolm, bring Fergus from
the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>rere!" While on the instant the equerry advanced, bringing a noble
Hanoverian charger of a beautiful cream colour, who loudly snorted,
neighed, and proudly pawed the ground. The stately animal was ready
caparisoned for the field.</p>

<p>The colonel next took a ring from off his finger; it was an antique
cameo, exquisitely sculptured; the gem was a ruby of immense value; the
subject was the genius of Victory crowning Hercules.</p>

<p>"This," said the colonel, "you must permit me to place on your hand, as
an humble mark of my esteem and admiration of the brave who belong to
every country. This and my trusty charger are the gages for the
fulfilment of my promise."</p>

<p>"In return," replied the duke, "noble and generous stranger," at the
same moment taking from out his bosom a diamond star, which was appended
to a chain of gold, "receive this diamond star!" And flinging it with
much grace around the colonel's neck, he added: "Wear this for sake of
me! This morning it was given me by my king, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>commanded me to place
it around the bravest neck and the boldest heart I should this day meet
in the field."</p>

<p>"Then," rejoined the stranger, "you should have reserved it for your
own, and have allowed it to remain; for where it <i>was</i> placed it best
became!"</p>

<p>"Not so, gallant Sir," resumed the duke, "my beloved sovereign's
mandates I have now faithfully fulfilled."</p>

<p>Here the bugles of the contending squadrons pealed forth "a recall," and
the duke of Tyrconnel and the Colonel of the Brandenburghers parted,
highly and mutually pleased, and earnestly hoping yet to meet. Having
warmly shaken hands, the duke adroitly vaulted on the Hanoverian
steed&mdash;it was the third which he had mounted on that bloody day! And
when both were on horseback, they once more cordially shook hands,
while each with much regret bade the other adieu!</p>

<p>Throughout this momentous battle Tyrconnel had performed prodigies of
valour: he was every where to be seen, every where <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>to be heard; his
rallying voice and look remonstrating with and encouraging the timid and
wavering, while gallantly he led on the brave to the charge. During this
deadly fight he lost three horses, which were shot beneath him, as has
been already mentioned. But still undismayed, he each time returned to
the charge; and if the crown of King James possibly could have been
preserved by the talents, loyalty, affection, and invincible courage of
an individual, it would have been fully secured by the firmness and
fidelity of Tyrconnel.</p>

<p>During the heat of the action at Old Bridge one of the Dutch dragoons of
the Prince of Orange rode up, and not knowing his person, clapped a
pistol to his head. "What!" calmly observed the prince, and with much
presence of mind, "what! do you not know your friends?"</p>

<p>The Count de Lauzun held firm for a considerable time in the village of
Old Bridge, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>although his troops were severely galled with the shells
which were incessantly poured against them from the mortars which the
Prince of Orange had planted at the entrance of the village. The count's
force was principally composed of French troops. At length, being
overpowered, he was reluctantly compelled to yield; however, he retired
in good order, leaving numbers of his opponents dead upon the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Major-General Hamilton, of whose exploits we have already made
honourable mention, was certainly, it must be allowed by all, an
experienced commander, and a brave soldier. He headed his cavalry in
conjunction with the Irish infantry, who were allotted to protect the
ford of Duleek. Several attempts hitherto, but in vain, were made upon
the enemy's post to force the ford; but now they were compelled to yield
to superior numbers. General Hamilton, upon finding that matters stood
thus, placed himself at the head of the cavalry who were to cooperate
with his infantry, fought with fierce and obstinate courage in repelling
the assailants; but being wounded in the head by a sabre blow, he was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
taken prisoner. The right wing of the Irish upon this event gave way,
and they retired from the hedges and ditches, &amp;c. where they had been
intrenched, and retreated across a bog to Duleek, where they attempted
to rally. But upon hearing that the left wing of their army was defeated
at Old Bridge, they gave way, and again retreated, leaving the pass at
Duleek undefended. Upon this, without losing the moment of advantage,
the Prince of Orange placed his troops in order, and directed a general
pursuit from all quarters. The close pressure of the enemy, the
consequent hurry of the flight, and the determination of the pursuers,
prevented the troops of King James from defending the pass at Duleek,
and the victory became complete and decided upon the part of King
William&mdash;which title he had now obtained by the sword; and then
tumultuous cries were heard shouting through the air, of "Nassau and
victory!&mdash;<i>Vive le Roy Guillaume!&mdash;Vive le h&eacute;ros Guillaume!&mdash;Orange
Boven!&mdash;Een overwinnaar Boven al!</i>" &amp;c. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>

<p>King William pursued with promptitude the flying troops of James, and
committed slaughter, chasing them four miles beyond Duleek. Night coming
on put a termination to the pursuit, and the pursuers were ordered to
return. They took possession of booty to a large amount, an extensive
train of baggage, chariots, waggons, horses, arms, and ammunition. All
the night the army of William stood to their arms. In this well fought
battle the Irish lost three thousand men; King William lost about one
thousand. The persons of note who were killed among the former army were
the Marquis d'Hackinkourt, Lord Dungannon, Lord Carlingford, and Sir
Neal O'Neal. Upon the part of King William was slain Field Marshal the
Duke of Schomberg, the wisest, bravest, and the greatest captain of the
age, and at the advanced age of seventy years this brave and valiant
hero fell! The brave Callimot&eacute; also was killed, and gloriously at the
head of his regiment, as has been already observed. At this battle also
was slain the celebrated and Reverend George Walker, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>had so
gallantly defended Derry; he was killed a few steps behind King William.
When the account of his death was brought to the king, His Majesty said,
"Fool that he was, what had he to do here?" "Words," as Sir John
Dalrymple justly remarks, "which dishonoured the living, not the dead!"</p>

<p>The passage of the Boyne by King William was an enterprise certainly the
most courageous that history can attest; and however great and glorious
was that day's victory, yet, nevertheless, dearly was it purchased in
having cost the life of Field Marshal Schomberg. Throughout this arduous
and bloody day King William received no manner of hurt, although he was
actively engaged in the height of the action. However, a cannon ball
carried away a piece of his coat; but he received no wound in
consequence. Throughout this eventful fight he was seen to chase the
field, to dispose and arrange every attack, and several times to lead on
the charge; and whenever his troops began to shrink, he was instantly
observed to rally and support them, displaying upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>every occasion firm
conduct, courage, and determined resolution.</p>

<p>King James had been often heard to declare, that "he was born to be the
sport of fortune!" But had he acted differently from what he did at the
battle of the Boyne, he would have placed himself above the reach of
fortune; had he determinedly mingled in the fight, and had he animated
his troops every where and upon all occasions by his presence and
example, instead of looking on, as latterly he did, a tame and timid
spectator from the church of Donore; in a word, had his nerves been as
firm as the hands and hearts of his Irish subjects were true, then
indeed all his hopes and fondest expectations of his restoration might
have been fully realized.</p>

<p>King William (in historic truth we must admit) did all that man,
statesman, or general, could do, to win over to his cause the Duke of
Tyrconnel. But the duke was too true, too just, too firm, and too
loyally fond of his royal master, to be tampered with, or <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>even to give
an ear to the proffered corruption. No! "he was true to the last."</p>

<p>The fate of this important battle was decided in a great degree by its
locality; for, however strange it may appear, both parties had neglected
to occupy the pass or ford of Slane. King William advanced in three
columns to the opposite banks of the river, reconnoitred, and adjusted
his plan of operation, determining to attack by the right and centre.</p>

<p>On the morning of the battle, in pursuance of this determination, he
detached a corps to pass by Slane. This force arrived sooner at its
destination than that sent by King James, who quickly saw his error when
it was too late to counteract it. The curve of the river there forced
the troops of James to make a considerable <i>detour</i>, whereby time was
given to William's detachment to arrive and seize the pass before they
could effect it; which having forded, and then formed, they advanced on
the left of the army of James, and extending their lines to the right,
they turned it, notwithstanding <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has a a morass">a morass</span> in its front, by which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
man&oelig;uvre it was compelled to fall back in confusion towards Duleek.
William so judiciously had combined his attack, that his centre was to
pass precisely at the time that his right should completely have engaged
the left of the army of King James. When that took place, his centre
column advanced against Old Bridge, and his left proceeded to the
fordes, which having passed, they obtained the opposite banks at the
projecting curve of the Boyne; they then formed at that point, and
received an attack from the right and centre of James, which having
fully repulsed, they advanced. In consequence of which movement the army
of James fell back in the distance of two miles to the heights of
Donore, where they formed, and then they again advanced to the charge;
but the cavalry of William having, in obedience to his orders,
completely turned their left, the fortune of the day was irretrievable,
and they were thus compelled to fall back with considerable loss to
Duleek, behind which station once more they rallied.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>We certainly think that too much praise cannot indeed be possibly given
to the brave and faithful Irish who so manfully supported King James,
however undeserving he might have been of that support. They acted
according to their conscience&mdash;according to their religion&mdash;and devoted
to their sovereign, as they were, by their sworn allegiance. Their
lawful, but unfortunate king, threw himself into the arms of his Irish
subjects for protection and a restoration to his rights; they instantly
thronged around the royal standard. Although certainly James was wholly
undeserving of this support, from his tyranny and oppression&mdash;"not fit"
indeed "to govern," but we cannot say "not fit to live;" yet still his
various arbitrary measures&mdash;his confinement of the seven bishops in the
tower of London&mdash;his cruel and ill advised Bill of Attainder in the
Irish Parliament&mdash;his reversal of the Act of Settlement, and various
other despotic acts, which impartial justice must ever assuredly
condemn;&mdash;yet still let History inscribe on the bright margin of her
page, and record down to the remotest point of time, the love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
affection, fidelity, and allegiance of a nation (but too often rashly
and unjustly condemned) upon whom the royal exile had flung himself, as
on a dear but desperate hope&mdash;a <i>derni&eacute;r resort</i>&mdash;and upon whose hearts
and arms he relied as the forlorn hope of his crown, dignity, and
restoration!</p>

<p>Let history hand down this, while it must not be denied that of this
protection and support James was in every respect wholly undeserving;
for in two words his character may be told&mdash;he was a bigot and a tyrant!</p>

<p>James having ungenerously, as unjustly, thrown some reflections on the
courage of his Irish troops, observing to some of his general officers,
"that he would never again trust his cause to an Irish army;" with much
spirit they replied: "That throughout the fight their troops had acted
no inglorious part, though unanimated by a princely leader; that while
William shared danger in common with his army, encouraging them with his
presence, by his voice, and by his example, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>yet that King James stood
aloof at a secure distance, the quiet spectator of a contest on the
result of which depended his crown and realms!" And then, with deep and
wounded indignation at such ingratitude, they nobly exclaimed:
"<i>Exchange kings! and once more we shall fight the battle again!</i>" A
more noble burst of deeply taunted feelings and justly aroused
indignation than this cannot be found in history.</p>

<p>The title of King William to the throne of these realms was the choice
of the people, from whom the sovereign power emanated: and in whatever
point of view the Revolution of 1688 may be considered, it cannot be,
however, denied, so long as truth exists, that it was most important to
the religious and civil liberty of three kingdoms; and, moreover, it
established an important <i>dictum</i>, or principle, in the Constitution,
then hitherto unknown, defining the duties of the monarch and of the
subject, and holding forth to both prince and people the immutable and
immortal truth, <span class="smcap">That allegiance and protection are reciprocal
obligations</span>!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the entire night previous to the battle of the Boyne, fearful
forebodings and dismal auguries preyed upon the superstitious mind of
King James. An owl had perched upon the apex of the royal pretorium, or
pavilion, which incessantly hooted mournfully throughout the live-long
night; and at break of day, when the army commenced its march, a flight
of ravens, the ill-omened birds of augury, accompanied and every where
pursued the royal standard, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>cawing, and wheeling around it in
continuous circles; and whenever it became stationary, they winged their
hovering flight above it in mid-air, while it waved in the breeze. The
same night the royal standard which streamed at Dublin Castle, from
Birmingham Tower, and which had been neglected in not having been taken
down at the royal departure, was rent in shivers from the force of the
storm which that night raged impetuously; and the gilt crown, which had
blazed on the top of the standard-staff, was hurled off into an
adjoining cemetery. Strange and unearthly noises were heard; and the
mournful wail of the banshee was distinctly heard, even amid the howling
of the storm; for such were the superstitions of those days, and in
which even many of the wise believed!</p>

<p>The troops of King James returned back to the Irish capital, but not, as
they had gone forth to battle, elate with hope, and flushed with the
expectance of victory. No, they returned with the hurried haste of a
rapid rout; while the crimsoned blush of indignant shame and defeat in
each visage as it passed, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>was too fully apparent to the scrutinizing
spectator. Fatigue and lassitude seemed somewhat, however, to retard, if
not paralize, the return of the troops; while vexation and
disappointment were deeply impressed in every look and motion, from the
general to the private soldier, which too manifestly told that they had
returned covered with defeat, not crowned with victory!</p>

<p>With all the rancour of fanatic rage, and all the ferocity of atrocious
civil war, the troops of King William pursued the royal fugitive. And
history is wholly silent as to whether any royal mandate was issued to
spare the life of King James, the father of Mary, who was the wife of
William!</p>

<p>For upwards of four hours, like a pack of ravening hounds tracking the
scent of blood, the soldiery continued to pursue at the heels of the
fugitives; and not satiated with the carnage of the victory which they
had achieved, having strewed the field of battle with three thousand
slain, and with which slaughter they might have been fully satiated.
However, when the army ceased to pursue <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>the fugitives, it was not from
a desire to desist, but from a physical inability to proceed, having
become wholly exhausted from the toil of battle, and fatigue of pursuit.
And under this conviction, King William gave the troops an entire day to
recover from the hardships which they had undergone.</p>

<p>King James, as he retired from the defeat, broke down all the bridges in
his rere; which act arose from the suggestions of the French
officers,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who, impatient to revisit their own country, hurried him
from Ireland, and added wings to his fears. As soon as King James had
returned to the Castle of Dublin, a letter awaited him from Louis the
Fourteenth's own hand, in which the French monarch informed James of the
victory of Fleurus, which had put it in his power to draw his garrisons
from Flanders to the coast; and also told of the station which his fleet
had taken, and prevented his enemies from succouring each other. In this
letter Louis urged him instantly to sail for France, and to leave the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
conduct of the war to his generals, with direct orders to protract it;
and promised to land him in England with thirty thousand men. A letter
which, while it filled James with hopes, covered him at the same time
with mortification, when he reflected upon the contrast between his own
situation and that of his ally.</p>

<p>It is a curious, but undoubted circumstance, that all the dispositions
made at the battle of the Boyne by King James, were counting upon
defeat, not on victory; for with a presaging mind he reflected that all
the precautions which he had taken were contrived to make retreat less
dangerous, but not to improve on victory. It was with the same
melancholy and ominous foreboding, that previous to the battle he
thought proper to despatch Sir Patrick Trant, a commissioner of the
Irish revenue, to prepare for him a ship at Waterford, that in case of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
defeat he might secure his retreat to France!<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Tyrconnel, who had fully resolved not to abandon the fallen
fortunes of his generous, but unfortunate king, made immediate and
prompt preparation for accompanying his sovereign into exile; and he
proceeded with this intent accordingly to take a tender farewell of his
duchess, his beloved daughter, and his sisters. He determined that the
duchess, Adelaide, and his sisters, should immediately depart from
Ireland, and proceed to the continent; and he recommended that Brussels
should be the city where, ultimately, they were to sojourn until more
propitious and peaceful times should arrive. To Sir Patricius Placebo,
upon whose known fidelity and prudence he felt every reliance, he
intrusted these dear pledges to his guidance and protection, and
strongly advised and urged their immediate departure for Parkgate, in
one of the royal yachts; they were to travel in as private a manner as
might be; and having staid a few days with their friends the Bishop of
Chester and Mrs. Cartwright, in the ancient city of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><i>Deva</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (as
Chester was called when in possession of the Romans,) in order to
recover from the fatigue of their voyage; and then they were to proceed
to the most convenient and safe port in England, from whence they were
to embark for the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The time of departure now approached, King James's saddle-horses,
travelling carriages, his suite and servants, &amp;c. were now all in
readiness in the upper castle-yard. The duke, who had been some time
sitting with his family, now arose to attend a council, and then to
depart with his royal master. He looked mournful and desponding, while
cordially and affectionately he bade farewell to his beloved family.</p>

<p>"Go!" said the duchess, in a melancholy accent, but accompanied with a
fixed and determined look; "Go, my dear lord, where duty, allegiance,
and affection call you, and where your king may well command your
presence. Go, and may the same Almighty <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>power that so often hath saved
thy life in battle, still guide, protect, and guard thee upon the seas,
and in distant lands! But the wife of Tyrconnel breathes no sigh!&mdash;the
wife of Tyrconnel shall shed no tear at her loved lord's departure! Now
a fallen and hapless sovereign well may claim thy presence, for in the
summer and sunshine of his fortune he forgot thee not! Indeed hadst
thou, my lord, neglected to depart, and to have remained here
ingloriously at home, then assuredly there would have been too meet
occasion for a wife's sorrow, to witness a husband's shame! But no;&mdash;the
soul of Tyrconnel shrinks from the touch or thought of aught that is
base and ignoble. I will only therefore say, (while she fondly embraced
the duke,) my dearest lord&mdash;farewell, and still remember me, and mine,
and thine!"</p>

<p>The duchess supported this affecting scene with much calmness&mdash;nay, with
firmness; however, it was apparent that she forcibly subdued, and had
conquered her feelings on the occasion.</p>

<p>But it was not so with Adelaide, who wept <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>bitterly while her parents
vainly endeavoured to repress those tears which then deeply burst forth,
which made her beauteous face more lovely still. Adelaide affectionately
doated upon both her parents, who were all tenderness and affection to
her: but particularly she loved her father; she was his daily companion
in his rides and in his walks. No wonder then, indeed, that Adelaide
should be the delight of his eye, and the pride and the happiness of his
heart!</p>

<p>The parting of friends is proverbially ever more or less affecting; our
minds misgive us, for we know not but this departure of those we love
may prove the last. And thus indelibly is associated the feeling and
apprehension, that <i>in this world</i> we <i>may</i> not ever meet again!</p>

<p>Immediately previous to the departure of King James from Dublin, on his
route for Waterford to embark for France, the king held a council, when
the Duke of Tyrconnel formally surrendered to him his patent as chief
governor of Ireland, which King James graciously accepted of. The
magistracy and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>common council of the city of Dublin were then
introduced, and presented agreeably to the royal command, when King
James stated to them, "That he had caused their attendance upon that
day, previous to his departure, in consequence of its having been
reported to him that upon the event of his departure from the city, and
upon King William's approach, it was intended that the city should be
given up to plunder, and destroyed by fire."</p>

<p>Among other matters his concluding words were: "I do therefore charge
you, by your allegiance, that you neither rifle the city by plunder, nor
destroy it by fire; but to your best preserve the peace and tranquillity
of this great city."</p>

<p>Having said this, he bowed most affably and king-like to all, and then
retired.</p>

<p>Without any further delay King James instantly ordered his suite to draw
up at the grand portal of the castle-hall; and this being obeyed, he
descended the great stair-case. He was attired in a round beaver hat,
surmounted by a large waving plume of ostrich <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>feathers, which were dyed
of a crimson colour; he wore a flowing peruke; a leather doublet, richly
gilt and embossed, was his dress. The ribbon of the garter flowed
gracefully from the right shoulder, while on his left breast sparkled a
small embroidered star of the garter; his flowing neck-handkerchief, of
rich lace, was tucked under the front of the doublet. He wore large
military gloves, with the Vandyke termination. His small-clothes
corresponded with the doublet, terminating with castellated trappings at
the knees; and on his feet he wore sandals, or royal <i>talaria</i>, richly
laced, with the Vandyke point; nearly a fac-simile of which may be seen
in an engraving of Le-Bas, from the celebrated painting of <i>l'Enfant
Prodigue</i> of Teniers: while over his majestic shoulders was flung a
royal roquelaire of rich crimson velvet, lined with ermine, and clasped
in front with a gold fibula, richly studded with diamonds.</p>

<p>The unfortunate James forthwith approached his Normandy charger, which
having borne him from defeat, was now destined to bear him on his way <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to exile from the throne of his fathers! He now with great grace and
facility adroitly and majestically mounted his steed, and uncovering his
head, and gracefully bowing to all, set out on his melancholy way,
surrounded by his general officers and staff, proceeding on his return
to France, a second time to seek an asylum at St. Germains.</p>

<p>He had just passed through Dame-gate, (now no more existing,) and which
led into the present crowded thoroughfare of Dame-street&mdash;at least such
it had been previous to the fatal and destructive union of the two
legislatures of Great Britain and Ireland&mdash;when two men of the vulgar
description of lounging blackguards that formerly infested the streets
of Dublin, (whose number fortunately has decreased, is hourly
decreasing, and is at the present point of time duly diminished, if not
wholly eradicated,) impudently here advanced, and were of that
description which might be called half wits and whole knaves, with a
tongue glib at joke or slander, and a hand alert and adroit in cleaning
a shoe, as it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>was prompt and tricky in picking a pocket. These fellows
now commenced whistling, tenor and counter-tenor, but in a subdued
measure, the tune of "Lilli burlero. <a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This was evidently not music to
the royal ear, for it was quite fully apparent that it deeply annoyed
the royal James. The Duke of Tyrconnel immediately intimated to the
officer of dragoons who rode with him, to order the trumpets to peal
forth a loyal note; which was instantly done, and "Lilli burlero" soon
was silenced. The reader may possibly recollect that this song attached
a large portion of unpopularity and ridicule to the cause of King James,
against whom and the Duke of Tyrconnel this lampoon was written. It has
been attributed to Lord Wharton, but we are rather inclined to ascribe
this satirical song to Lord Bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p><p>As the unfortunate monarch rode along, the tradesmen in the principal
streets through which he was to pass, had caused all their shop windows
to be closed; a silent, but impressive and delicate, tribute to fallen
greatness! James deeply felt it. "Generous nation!" thought he, "much
have I wronged you, but now you forget it all. You have indeed shed your
best and bravest blood in my defence; and now on my fall, and my final
departure, you pay me this last, silent, but sincere, tribute of regret
at my departure. Oh, indeed I never shall&mdash;never can forget you!"</p>

<p>Having passed through the city of Dublin and the adjoining villages, the
royal fugitive proceeded in his flight, and soon reached the borders of
the county of Dublin. Here, beneath a vast cromlech, was seen seated an
ancient harper, his long thin grey locks streaming in the breeze; he
heeded not the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>royal cavalcade as they were passing along, but still
continued playing on his harp a mournful melody, sad and solemn as the
<i>Cath Eachroma</i>. Meanwhile King James had reined in his Normandy steed
to listen to the song. The bard again commenced in a measure, <i>d&ograve;lce ed
affettu&ograve;so</i>, the following</p>

<p class="center">BALLAD.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">I heard them repining for Erin declining,<br /></div>

  </div>

  <div class="stanza">

  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Wherever I wander I mournful ponder,<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Lamenting the issue of Boyne's woful fray;<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">O Erin, my country! no lover loved fonder,<br /></div>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>
   <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a><br /><br /></span></p>

<p>King James did not appear, in sooth, to be overcharmed with this
mournful ditty; and having hasty recourse to his spur, he pressed onward
his gallant courser; when dropping one of his stirrups, like Jason of
yore, of Argonautic fame; in this expedition the king lost one of his
sandals, or royal <i>talaria</i>. So far the mishap differed from Jason's
case, that it fell not into a stream, but upon dry ground; and
tradition, to the present hour, points out the place, or, as the
gentlemen of the long robe would express it, "lays the venue" at Red
Gap, where this occurrence took place.</p>

<p>Whether the royal sandal was, or was not, made of <i>red</i> Morocco, or
Turkey leather, which thus may have happily given an <i>agnomen</i> to the
gap, seems such a dilemma, that we shall not rashly venture to pronounce
upon so knotty and important a point as it appears, but leave the
discussion to learned antiquaries, and the exposition to profound
etymologists, more conversant with such grave and consequential matters
than we can possibly presume to be acquainted withal.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>At this place King James alighted from his horse, and accompanied by the
Duke of Tyrconnel, entered the royal travelling carriage. No occurrence
worthy of notice took place during the remainder of the journey; and the
same evening the royal cavalcade reached Waterford in perfect safety.
There Sir Nicholas Porter, the mayor of Waterford, and the corporation,
respectfully waited upon King James; and the mayor had a grand banquet
most hospitably prepared at Reginald's Tower, where the king dined and
slept.</p>

<p>The Duke of Tyrconnel expressed his ardent wishes and determination to
accompany his royal master to France, which King James said he would not
hear of, nor admit. The king then took a valuable diamond ring from his
royal hand, and placing it on Tyrconnel's, he said, with much feeling
and emphasis, while he warmly pressed the hand upon which he placed it,
"Tyrconnel, I well know that you <i>will</i> remember me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my beneficent Sire, I shall beyond all possibility of doubt; when
I shall forget <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>my beloved king, then may heaven for ever forget and
forsake me!"</p>

<p>Here Tyrconnel knelt, and with warm affectionate zeal and affection
kissed the hand of the royal exile.</p>

<p>"Wear that, Tyrconnel, as a pledge of my unaltered and unalterable
affection. I am at present, from the cogency and crisis that my fortunes
have assumed, necessitated to yield to superior force; but I shall never
cease to labour for the deliverance of my faithful Irish subjects so
long as I shall live."</p>

<p>He then added in a slow, solemn, and affecting tone: "I charge you,
Tyrconnel, upon your allegiance, and by your love for me, to hasten, so
soon as you shall witness my embarkation, to return back to the bosom of
your family; restore a husband to your wife, and, to <i>my</i> Adelaide&mdash;my
beauteous god-child, a father. Hasten to go! and the most affectionate
regards of your faithful sovereign and friend attend you! I say prepare
to go!"</p>

<p>"Please your Majesty," the duke replied, "I most respectfully obey; but
surely your <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>Highness will not, cannot, I humbly hope, refuse me a boon,
and that which I respectfully conceive to be merely the duty of a loyal
subject to claim, and that is, my liege, to witness your safe return to
Saint Germains; and then I will return to my family."</p>

<p>This request was at once acceded to by King James; who concluded by
saying, "I was indeed born to be the sport of fortune!" This he had
often said before; and now he repeated his favourite apothegm.</p>

<p>King James withdrew to repose at an early hour; and Tyrconnel, who slept
in the outward room, adjoining his sovereign, was in attendance. The
Duke of Tyrconnel retired to bed, but not to repose. He now rapidly
retraced in mental review the occurrences of years, and the still more
surprising events, the fatal result of a very few days, that had so
rapidly succeeded each other in a fatally consecutive train. "Oh, what a
contrast," he thought, "there is between the triumphant landing some
months before at Kinsale, and the deeply humiliating departure that upon
the following day shall take <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>place on the royal embarkation from
Waterford!"</p>

<p>Oppressed more by mental than bodily fatigue, at length Tyrconnel
insensibly sunk into a profound sleep; but it was unaccompanied with
that refreshment which the balmy sleep of health ought to bestow. It was
restless and disturbed. The vision of his beloved monarch's landing at
Kinsale floated in vivid colours before him, and once more presented in
detail the event as it had happened; once more he stood uncovered upon
the beech of Kinsale, anxiously awaiting the landing of his sovereign,
and to pay his dutiful homage; once more he heard the loud exultant
exclamations of congregated thousands; once more he witnessed the rapid
flash, and heard the succeeding thunder of deep-toned salutation</p>

<p class="center">"From the loud cannons' mouth."</p>

<p>Again standards waved in the air, and were lowered to the earth, to hail
the sovereign's auspicious approach; the military presented arms; the
burst of harmony from the various <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>regimental bands, and the universal
shouts of joy made the welkin ring. The entire body of the Roman
ecclesiastics, all habited in their meet and proper costume, assembled,
and kneeled upon the beach, while the host was borne in high and solemn
procession. The congregated nobles and gentry were all duly marshalled
upon the strand, in meet accordance to their rank and dignity, loyally
and affectionately to receive, and congratulate the arrival of their
beloved monarch, while "every inch a king," and right royally arrayed,
standing erect in the royal pinnace which rowed him to the Irish shore;
while the royal standard floated at the stern, and the stately pinnace,
decked and emblazoned with all the circumstance, pride, and splendour of
heraldic pomp, blazed forth richly illumined by a vernal sun, and seemed
at once to diffuse hope, joy, and confidence around.</p>

<p>Here, upon his landing, King James was welcomed by a number of young
persons of both sexes&mdash;the one remarkable for their manly graces, as the
other for their lovely <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>faces and forms&mdash;who joined hands in the
celebrated <i>Rinceadh-Fada</i>,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or Irish dance, which pleased the monarch
exceeding well, who often afterwards spoke of it, saying how highly he
had been delighted with it. King James now approached Tyrconnel, whom he
warmly grasped. Upon this "the fabric of his vision" was completely
dissolved; for Tyrconnel was now broad awake. He took off the diamond
ring which his royal master had given him the night before, devoutly
pressed it to his lips, and arose, for it was now day, feverish and
unrefreshed from his couch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened the casement of his window to admit the balmy breeze of the
morning, and taking from his finger the diamond ring, he cut with its
sharp and brilliant point the following lines on a pane of the
lattice:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>King James and his suite having breakfasted, and all matters being in
readiness, the embarkation commenced. Gloom, silence, and despondence
seemed every where to prevail. The king, in ascending the vessel
prepared for him, and which was called "the Count de Lauzun," was
assisted by the Duke of Berwick, the Duke of Tyrconnel, Marquis Powis,
the Marquis d'Avaux, ambassador of France, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But it was amid
universal silence they embarked! No shout, cheer, or exclamation, was
heard; no pomp, no parade, was exhibited; not even a royal salute from
the guns in the harbour!</p>

<p>However, amongst the populace there was, or seemed to be, a feeling of
pity, but somewhat allied to contempt, and more approaching anger rather
than sorrow. Thus the royal exile departed from the shores of Ireland,
without a single cap having been flung up, or an individual voice to
exclaim,</p>

<p class="center">"God save King James!"</p>

<p>Such ever is the fate of fallen greatness! <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>King James now spread full
sail for the coast of France, and was the first who brought tidings of
his own dreadful defeat.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> All the French court appeared to be much
affected, and sorrow was manifested throughout the entire realm. But one
piece of news so sad for France, was immediately followed by another,
which produced a general joy,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> although, however, it was of short
duration in the hearts of all those who were interested in the disgrace
of that fugitive prince.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> A <i>valet de chambre</i> of King James, who
preceded his master, returning from Ireland to Paris, related as a fact
that the Prince of Orange was killed by a cannon shot, which he had
received on the day of the battle.</p>

<p>The prince was considered dead throughout all France; and as one
believes with facility what they are desirous should happen, people did
not wish to stop or examine if that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>news should prove false. The
report, as circulated, was, that the Prince of Orange had been killed by
a cannon shot in fording the river Boyne. The first account which they
had at Paris arrived at midnight; and all the commissioners of the wards
were despatched, by order of Louis XIVth, to knock at the doors of the
citizens, and to tell them in a triumphant tone that the Prince of
Orange was dead, and that they must arise and rejoice! At the expiration
of a few moments the whole city appeared illuminated. Drums and trumpets
were heard in all directions, nor was there to be seen a single street
where they had not lighted fires. Never, even at the birth of princes,
had been displayed so many attestations of joy as then blazed abroad in
France, at the account of the pretended death of the Prince of Orange.
The populace hastily made effigies of King William and Queen Mary, which
they drew through the dirt, treated with every indignity, and afterwards
burned them. The bells of <i>Notre Dame</i>, and many other churches rang
peals of joy, and the cannon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>of the Bastile were fired. Finally,
nothing was forgotten which was customary to be done on the most solemn
occasions. These rejoicings lasted for many days, which were celebrated
in feasts and all other kinds of diversions.</p>

<p>The public joy spread itself from Paris to all the other cities,
accompanied with the news of the death which was the cause of it. But it
was more astonishing, and what, perhaps, no prince ever before did for
the death of an enemy, the King of France gave orders to all the
garrisons of provinces to cause to be fired <i>feux de joi&eacute;</i> in all places
of public resort!&mdash;and, finally, to crown all, (what horrid impiety!)
even religion was called in and made a partaker of the public joy!</p>

<p><i>Te Deum</i> was chanted in the cathedral church of <i>Notre Dam</i>, where
members of the parliament assisted, clad in their red robes, to return
thanks to heaven for the death of the Prince of Orange!!!<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>For the present we must proceed to other matters, while the Duke of
Tyrconnel is employed in attending his unfortunate sovereign<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> to the
court of Saint Germains, and while the duchess and her family, escorted
by Sir Patricius Placebo, are performing their voyage to Parkgate, we
must, in the mean time, advert to our shipwrecked voyagers, who were
very early noticed in our history, and whom, with very little
consideration indeed upon our part, we have allowed so long to remain at
Ostend, and in durance vile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was omitted to mention in the foregoing chapter that King James, in
his passage to France, met with the French fleet of frigates which M.
Seignelai had originally intended to burn the English shipping on the
coast of England, and which subsequently was destined to burn William's
transports upon the coast of Ireland;&mdash;but communicating to other
nations the bad fortune which attended himself, he carried it back to
France with him for the security of his person."&mdash;<i>Rapin's History of

<p>It is incumbent here that we should again return to Ostend, and attend
our shipwrecked voyagers, who have been left so long in durance vile, as
contained in the first chapter of our first volume; and advert to other
notable accidents worthy to be known, related, and recorded.</p>

<p>Our readers then will vouchsafe to recollect of what importance, as a
seaport, Ostend is, and ever has been considered, being only second in
rank to Dunkirk. Indeed the possession of Ostend in every war has been <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
always accounted of the highest consequence by every belligerent power,
as well as by the sovereigns too of the Low Countries. The oriental
situation of Ostend has given to it its name, by which one might express
<i>a port which looks to the east</i>; and its armorial bearing<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> implies
that it is one of the principal keys of Austrian Flanders.</p>

<p>Ostend had formerly been the simple station of fishermen, established
between Nieuport and Helvoetsluys; but, increasing from various
combining events, it gradually arose to consequence, numerous causes
having co-operated to its enlargement. The origin of the civil wars&mdash;the
fears created by the numerous pirates throughout the entire provinces of
the Low Countries, &amp;c., these gradually led to its increase, and Ostend
became a place of strength and importance; her port enriching her trade
and revenue by bringing home the merchandize of Europe; while her strong
fortifications protected and secured the inhabitants from the
machinations of their enemies; and, finally, the peace of Ghent having
completely established the power of the confederated states.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>At the period of which we speak Ostend was progressively recovering from
the fatal effects of a protracted siege, conducted by the Spaniards
under Spinola, which had lasted for the space of three years; and upon
the last day of the siege it was as uncertain as upon the first whether
it would be captured by the Spaniards or not; or to which side victory
finally would belong. The account of the loss of lives on the part of
the besiegers and the besieged in this disastrous siege, is truly most
formidable; it is computed that fifteen thousand of the latter perished;
some slain by the sword of war, others fell by pestilence, and others
perished the victims of the marshy climate of Ostend, from fatigue of
the siege, the sorties, engagements, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>fire of the enemy; while the
Spaniards suffered the severe loss of upwards of seventy-eight thousand
men.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>But we must now return to the detail of our voyagers, who having ate a
hearty supper at their hotel, soon retired to repose in their respective
chambers. Oh, how refreshing to the wearied spirit is the renovating
balm of sleep; and how invigorating is a night's undisturbed repose! And
how great, how unspeakable the change, and how joyful the contrast, from
the almost certain expectancy of death by a watery grave, it is upon the
succeeding morning to awake, as if from the tomb, upon a bed of down,
and to hail the blessed cheering light of morning! Who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>could forbear to
raise the adoring eye and the grateful heart to heaven, for an escape so
unexpected and providential! All this they deeply and devoutly felt.</p>

<p>The morning succeeding their preservation, while they were actively and
busily occupied in the important despatch of an incomparable breakfast,
and the fellow-sufferers were passing a high and well deserved eulogium
on some excellent Malines ham, to their great surprise and dismay a
party of <i>Gens d'Armes</i>, as has been before remarked, arrived at their
hotel, when (the three of them) the colonel, his servant, and Doctor
M'Kenzie, were arrested under suspicion of being spies, and were thrown
into prison.</p>

<p>"This is somewhat too hard," observed Doctor M'Kenzie, "not to be
allowed to swallow our rations of excellent ham! A few hours ago to have
escaped the whirlpool of Charybdis, and this morn to be shipwrecked on
the rock of Scylla! The sea was well nigh swallowing us yesterday, and
to-day we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> are to be immured in prison on suspicion of being spies;</p>

<blockquote><p>'Dextrum Scylla latus, l&aelig;vum implacata Charybdis Obsidet.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Yes, my Reverend Friend," replied the colonel, "this is all but too
true, we have had our share of suffering indeed; but while we feel it as
men, let us also bear it like men, and hope the best! For my own lot I
care not; to me death, not captivity, would be welcome!"</p>

<p>To account for this arrest we must apprise our readers that Marshal de
Rantzau had made a desperate attempt with only two thousand French
troops, a very few years previous to the period of which we now speak.
But eventually the French force was put to flight, with the loss of
twelve hundred brave and gallant men, who fatally fell in this rash
attempt. And this event it was which caused such alertness and suspicion
regarding strangers to be adopted by the government and garrison of
Ostend.</p>

<p>The prisoners were marched along under <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>a strong escort of the <i>Gens
d'Armes</i>, and were conducted to the chief prison, and handed over to the
surveillance of the head gaoler, Mr. Phelim O'Neale, who, by the way,
happened to be a countryman of the Reverend Doctor M'Kenzie. At that
period the janitor of a gaol did not enjoy the present high diplomatique
distinction of being termed the <i>governor</i> or <i>warder</i> of a
grated citadel.</p>

<p>While Mr. Phelim O'Neale was showing his prisoners the apartments
allotted to them, he said, addressing the Reverend Clerk:&mdash;"I know that
your Riverence is my countryman, and perhaps I know still more; I
therefore feel all the respect and affection which I ought to do for a
countryman in a foreign land. My life has been a varied and changeable
one, and it may perchance beguile away an hour of captivity, that you
should deign to listen to my story. Och, I was once a roving and
untamable bird, wild as the haggard-hawk<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of my native hills, that is
ever on the excursive wing; and like to it, I was not to be tamed at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
all; but now, in troth, I am tame enough, any how! For the present I
shall only say, that from peculiar and urgent circumstances I was
compelled to leave my native land. I embarked from the bay of Tyrconnel
in Ireland, in a vessel bound for Virginia; at sea I was taken prisoner
by the fleet and squadron of Marshal de Rantzau; and with the force of
his Highness I was landed at this good city, ould Ostind. Well here I
was a wandering raw recruit on Flemish ground, an unknown exile and
outcast, forsaken by all, from Dan to Beersheba! Howsomdever, I was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
shortly thrown in the way of my brave countryman, Count Dillon, whom I
knew when I was a gossoon. He was a lieutenant curnell, sarving under
the marshal; and he was not slow in discovering that I possessed both
cuteness and genus.&mdash;<i>Vous avez razon mun infant!</i> he would often
say to me, (he had lived for years in France,) and yit, by my blessed
sowl, I often thought that his honourable worship himself had no razon
at all, at all!"</p>

<p>"Fie, fie! Mr. Phelim O'Neale; swear not at all! it is a work of
supererogation for selling yourself, both body and soul, gratis to the
infernal power! Let me hear no more of it."</p>

<p>"Well, your Riverence, no sooner said than done," says poor Phelim
O'Neale; "by &mdash;&mdash; I will swear no more!"</p>

<p>"There again!&mdash;swearing an oath that you will not swear! Who ever heard
the like before;&mdash;what impious inconsistency!"</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Riverend Father, for this time, and you shall no more
catch me tripping, nor stumbling, nor swearing. Och, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>murder! although I
have endured enough to make any feeling Christian swear hard enough&mdash;at
times, any how, to be sure! by &mdash;&mdash; I mean maybe through a thick deal
board itself! Well, your Riverence, to continue the thrid of my
story:&mdash;Count Dillon one day took me aside, and said, 'Phelim, I clearly
persave that you are a quick, cute lad, and you must assist me in a plan
which I have in disjunction joined with the Marshal Rantzau, for
suddenly surprising Ostind, and taking it by a parabolous stratagism,
the most admirable and intripid that was ever known, thought of, or yet
imagined by any bould pioneer,' as your Riverence shall hear anon. It
was in the month of June, and upon the memorable fifteenth day thereof,
in the year 1600 and&mdash;though I can't precisely recollect the date upon
which we resolved for the execution of this intended daring and glorious
enterprise, for our attacking force consisted of but two thousand men.
Our stratigismus was to surprise Ostind by the gate of Nieuport, which
lay upon the land side, and next to the town of Nieuport. We hoped that
by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>the introduction of a large body of men we might possibly, perhaps
certainly, possess ourselves of the town and citadel of ould Ostind.
Accordingly, to be sure, with this intint, we well surveyed the gate;
and before that we had geoggraphyz'd the intire country, and all the
roads and passes disjacent, whersomby that by every measure and means,
and all due secrecy, that our attacking force might be intraducted, and
back our noble and elegant enterprise. Accordingly some half dozen
soldiers, clad in garb of Flemish peasants, in their blue caps and blue
frocks; and wherewithal supporting upon their backs sacks well stored
with chesnuts, walnuts, &amp;c., were to seem as if they had brought them
for sale into town; and thin, upon an appointed signal, (the sacks
loosely tied,) the pretinded peasants were to let them fall, (accidently
on purpose no doubt,) and scatter their contints around upon the ground,
which was to cause a general scramble, and take off the attention of the
guard from the object which we had in view. This having taken place, the
fore-said soldiers, or disguised peasants, were to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>rally around a
waggon, or, as they call it here, a charabbon, under the same pretence,
laden with baskets of fruit and vegetables, strawberries, cherries,
peas, beans, &amp;c. &amp;c. The thing was so managed that within the waggon
there were concealed about thirty soldiers. As being the chief
projector, the honourable post of heading this desperate attempt,
(which, if it succeeded, was soon to be followed by a powerful force,)
was consigned, gentle Sirs, to your intripid and very devoted sarvant,
Phelim O'Neale."</p>

<p>"And pray, Mr. Phelim O'Neale, if it be not taking too great a liberty,
may I inquire what induced Count Dillon to place such confidence in
<i>you</i>, and make <i>you</i> the head of the pioneers, or of this stratagem,
upon the success of which, it would appear, turned the entire success of
the attack?"</p>

<p>"Och, botheration! and that too I will confiss to your Riverence. 'I
think,' says I, Curnell, plaze your worthy honour's worship, that I
could suggist a matter to your grace's judgment that would, all in all,
carry the day, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>and, in troth, we should soon be in possession of ould
Ostind!'</p>

<p>"'Indeed! Mr. Phelim O'Neale; pray tell, are you on the staff?&mdash;I
suppose a general at least!' said he.</p>

<p>"'Not I, by my own sowl!' says I. 'No, not even a corporal! But then
your noble and valiant worship knows, howsomdever, that there is a
little fish, not larger than four inches in lingth, and about one in
bridth, that pilots and leads on the great commodore of the ocean; I
mean, plaze your most noble worship, the pilot fish,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that steers
onward the mighty shark, the goliathan of the ocean, to the wictims of
his prey! What do you think now, noble commander, of this apt
dissimilitude?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, pardon, good honest friend O'Neale, <i>vous este une bon garcon</i>!'</p>

<p>"Upon my own conscience we call this better in ould Ireland by the name
of gossoon!&mdash;but no matter as to that. He then axed me if I had any
patience; 'for,' said he, 'you Irish have no patience at all;' and then
talked to himself, that the Irish were like one fiery hot Harry Hotspur,
an Hottentot I suppose, that had no forbearance nor patience at all, at
all!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Och, then, noble commander,' said I, 'I am the patient, enduring boy
after all; I am stationary as an owl at mid-day within an ivy bush! and
as patient and forbearing (baring till the time comes) as a heron
perched upon the brink of a fish-brook! Och, then, by my own sowl, 'tis
I am the lad that will wait for you till the very cows come
home!&mdash;troth, sure enough, I would at any hop of the ball!'</p>

<p>"'Bravo, bravo! my bould boy;' replied Count Dillon, 'you are the very
boy for my business and project&mdash;all shall go on well!' He then
ejoculated, '<i>vous avez razon, vous avez razon</i>,' until I fairly thought
that he would have lost his own razon all out and out, any how!"</p>

<p>"But pray proceed, Mr. Phelim O'Neale, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>with your narrative, in which I
begin to take some little interest."</p>

<p>"Thus emboldened, your Riverence, as I was by my commander's lave, I up
and tould him, as I till you and your friend, all my plan, of which he
highly approbated. Every matter being duly prepared, a time for making
the grand attack was appointed. The soldiers who were to make the
attempt, as I have already tould your Riverence, were all disguised as
Flemish peasants, in their blue caps and blue frocks, and were each man
to have a Flanders' pipe stuck in his jaw, and smoking away briskly, as
much as to say, <i>the devil may care for yeez all</i>! I will now till the
whole of my contrivance, as plotted and planned from the first to the
last, without any deviation or prevarication from the truth at all, at
all! To go on then with my story:&mdash;the charabbon, or waggon, contained,
as already I have said, thirty soldiers, who upon this occasion were to
be headed by me; in the cart we had several stout planks of oak, which
were destinated for a treble purpose: firstly, to hide us who were
packed beneath, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>but whose hearts were strong and unbending as the
planks over our heads; and secondly, to support some baskets of fruit
and vegetables, for which this country is most remarkable."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Doctor M'Kenzie, addressing Colonel Davidson, "it is
recorded that when Anne of Cleves, the queen consort of King Henry
VIII., wanted a sallad, she used to despatch a messenger to Flanders to
procure one."</p>

<p>The colonel nodded his assent, and requested Mr. Phelim O'Neale to
proceed onward with his tale.</p>

<p>"Well the planks were, as I said, destinated for a treble purpose, I
have tould two of these; the third was, in the last place, to erect them
as uprights, to prevent the falling of the portcullis upon our skulls
who were to make the attack. And the charabban was intentionally, on
purpose to be sure, to be overturned at the door of the guard-house to
block up the guard while cracking their walnuts, &amp;c. If this attempt of
gaining the Nieuport-gate had succeeded, a carabine was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>to have been
fired to give a signal to the Marshal de Rantzau, who was stationed with
the remainder of our force, which, as I have already obsarved, amounted
to two thousand men; and upon their coming up in time, in obedience to
the signal, we were sure and sartin of the capture of Ostind.</p>

<p>"We had thus anxiously planned, and with strong grounds and hopes of
success, this elegant enterprise, which was to burst forth upon the
fifteenth day of June; whether the termination was fortunate or the
reverse will soon be tould yeez. The military gait and air of the
supposed peasants it is thought led to suspicion, and seemed to awaken
the attention of the garrison. Just when the charabbonier<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> drove up
his wehicle in which I was, and approached to the Nieuport-gate of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Ostind, forward advanced the damniers, (douaniers,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or custom-house
officers,) and with their accustomed agility forth flew their rapiers,
flashing in the bright summer glow of the harvest moon; they cut, and
thrust, and terced, prodding the contints of the waggon without any
distinction or respect of persons or property, whether dead or alive
stock, but according to custom, searching for counter-brand goods and
chattels. At length a sharp Toledo of one of these damned damniers stuck
in one of my ribs, and sure enough the blood began to leak. 'Arah,'
roared I, 'what the d&mdash;l are you perpetrating; and would you be after
murdering me, you Flanders' boucher!'</p>

<p>"'Ah, hah!&mdash;<i>Jean Bull!</i>&mdash;<i>Jean diable!</i>' cried he aloud, '<i>emportez
soldats! ca herse&mdash;bas&mdash;bas&mdash;ouvrez le fenetre!</i>' Which every body knows
is 'shut the gate!' And sure enough bang down went the portcullis, up
leapt the draw-bridge; and closed and securely bolted and barred in no <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
time were the gates. And, oh, 'tis true enough, poor Phelim O'Neale had
got sartain and sure at the wrong side of the gate, where he was soon
made prisoner, and all his brave plans completely dumb-foundered and
knocked upon the head in one short and sad moment. I with several
others, thus caught in this Flemish trap, were made prisoners; while
suspicion being aroused, and all our resources having been cut off,
outnumbered as Marshal Rantzau was by the enemy, it was only left him to
sound a retreat, and retire to his chaloupes, (large boats.)</p>

<p>"After having remained for a long period in prison, I at last caught the
attention of the head gaoler, who taking a fancy to me, made me his
under gaoler; and some years after, (seven I think,) upon his death, I
was constatuted head gaoler. And here I am; I have a good salary, a good
roomy house, and with the allowance of coals and candles. I am married
to a pretty, and what is far better, to a good Flemish lass; and we have
already four childer in the space of three years, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>the Lord be
praised they are all the right sort&mdash;they are all of the emasculate
ginder! So that I am, in troth, in some sort of mizzure indamnified for
my losses and sufferings by the post which I here hould."</p>

<p>Mr. Phelim O'Neale, the head gaoler, or, in phrase modern,
<i>diplomatique</i>, the head governor of the citadel, paid the most marked
attention to his prisoners; and said, that before the morning's dawn he
would think of something that would ixtrickate them from their prison.
"For when a man gets into a scrape or difficulty, Riverend Father, he
has only to consult an Irishman, who will be sure and sartain to get him
safely and genteely out of it."</p>

<p>"Ay, the Nieuport-gate of Ostend and the Spanish Toledo to wit," thought
Doctor M'Kenzie to himself, "is a full elucidation of the truth of this
proposition!"</p>

<p>Now having left them a most comfortable dinner, or supper, and which
answered for both; with a bottle or two of <i>vin du pays</i>, and some true
and veritable Rhenish wine, the warder of the citadel wished his inmates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>a good night. But before he departed he took Doctor M'Kenzie aside, and
whispered him&mdash;"I have so managed it that by to-morrow you and your
friend shall have separate apartments at night; to-morrow the
arrangement shall take place, and I have much to say to you, holy
Father, in secret, and to make many confissions when we shall meet alone
on the morrow."</p>

<p>The next morning by times the warder arrived, and introduced a plentiful
and excellent breakfast, not forgetting some excellent Malines ham, in
the digestion of which they had been so rudely interrupted at the inn of
the old Saint Michael. When breakfast was over he again returned; when
opening his cloak, he produced a violin and clarionet. "Do any of you
play upon these instruments?" said Phelim O'Neale.</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined Doctor M'Kenzie, "I was wont in happier days than these
to play for my pastime upon the violin. But such a question now in such
a place&mdash;say to what can it tend? I have no such fancy in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>deed at
present, I can assure you, my good and kind Mr. Phelim O'Neale." Who,
however, proceeded, quite unrestrained by his Reverence's rebuke&mdash;"Can
nobody play upon the clarionet?"</p>

<p>After some delay and hesitation, at length with diffidence the colonel's
servant said, "Yes, Sir, I once could play upon it when I was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that," said Phelim, "will do capitally! excellent! quite enough!
strim-stram&mdash;drimendreuch! All will now, in troth, go on quite well, and
with grate success, any how!"</p>

<p>He then laid down the musical instruments, and putting his hands in his
pocket, produced several files and saws of various forms and sizes, and
then produced a bottle of vitriol. "My plan," added he, "is now fully
ripening for the liberation of yeez three; these instruments and
implements are intinded to saw asunder the prison bars of your dungeon
window, which being within a short distance from the ground, your
freedom easily can be afficted without either damage or difficulty, or
even resaving a slight prod in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>small ribs, when you shall have duly
accomplished the nibbling asunder of the meshes which confine yeez! And
the Rev. Doctor with his fiddle, and this honest-faced lad with his
clarionet&mdash;och, och, it will all do bravely and rarely to murder and
drown, aye, and bother, that brave and grave gentleman's operatusses in
sawing the bars; och, by my sowl, the filing will be fairly bothered.
And troth yeez shant want for paper and paste to hide and cover your
dainty devices in caase any body should come in, he must needs admire
the nateness of your apartment."</p>

<p>"Sawing iron! ah," said Doctor M'Kenzie, "that is a harsh and grating
amusement!" And then turning to the man of war, he said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">"They little know what ills environ<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">The man who meddles with cold iron!"<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The colonel frowned, and seemed displeased.</p>

<p>The honest-hearted Phelim O'Neale, for such he was with all his faults
and transgressions to boot, now bade a good night to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>his imprisoned
friends, as he called them; and then whispered aside, that on the
ensuing morow he would beg the favour to make his confessions to the
Reverend Clerk what time the apartment should be ready for his gallant
friend, which was under preparation, and would be ready to receive him
early upon the following morning. He then bowed, and wished them all "a
very good night's repose." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p><hr class="chap" />

<p>"Now, holy and most Riverend Sir, that my eyes are blessed with seeing
your benevolent visage once more," said Phelim O'Neale, "and that I
behold you in these sad towers, the abode of crime and of guilt, which
indeed never belonged to you, and that we are in private, with your
riverend permission, I will make my confission unto you. Don't your
reverence remember me?"</p>

<p>"Not I, in sooth."</p>

<p>"What! not remember Phelim O'Neale?"</p>

<p>"Not I, in sooth, honest Mr. Phelim O'Neale." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, baring (excepting) <i>honest</i>; that any how for the present we will
pass by. But, holy Father, if you knew but all, you have far too many
reasons not to forget me! Do you not remember that you stood by me
during my last moments, and gave me the holy ritals of the church?"</p>

<p>"What do I hear! Stood by you in your last moments, and gave you the
holy rituals of the church! and here you are!! The poor man is
deranged&mdash;quite crazed. You are beside yourself, Mr. Phelim (without
<i>honest</i>) O'Neale!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Riverend Father, I am <i>beside you</i>, or rather forenent you.
Do you not remember, your Riverence, that some tin years ago (small
blame howsomdever to your Riverence any how, for grate razon you have,
in troth, to remember Phelim O'Neale, if you knew but all!)&mdash;well, as I
said, some tin years ago you attended me at the gaol of Tyrconnel in my
last moments; you were present when I was hanged&mdash;ay, regularly
hanged!!"</p>

<p>"Hanged! hanged!" ejaculated Doctor <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>M'Kenzie; "and yet you are
here!&mdash;You speak, you address me! How is this? It is madness all!"</p>

<p>"Not so neither, craving your excellent Riverence's pardon; I was tried
for high-way robbery at the assizes of Tyrconnel;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> I then most justly
was found guilty, and condamnified by the circuit-going judge, Justice
Jocum, to be hanged. And sure enough, by my sowl, hanged I fairly
was&mdash;no doubt whatever of it! That is to say the hangman did his part,
as the judge and jury had before done theirs; and my friends did the
rest. Och, they did their part, sure enough&mdash;long life to them for the
same! At that most memorable 'pocha of my life&mdash;or death! as it was by
all supposed, thought, and credited, your worthy and excellent Riverence
attended me in my last sad and awful moments. Thin you saw me mount the
fatal ladder; the hangman gave me a hempen cravat, which, in troth, I
but too well desarved! and the ladder having been suddenly taken <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>away,
I made a spring, and, as all thought, I jumpt into itirnity. But you
remimber, or might remimber, that before I was launched from the fatal
tree, I bouldly kicked off my brogues, and died true game. And och, may
be I didn't kick them off in stylo! as much as to indiccate to my
commeradoes, 'Yeez see, jewels, that I die true game; and moreover, none
shall suffer in the dead man's shoes&mdash;not one of yeez! This plainly
tould them all a true tale, that I had not confissed, or betrayed any of
them by a cowardly disacknowledgment."</p>

<p>"Oh, shame, shame!" rejoined Doctor M'Kenzie, "kicking off your brogues
upon the scaffold, on the confines of eternity, in the sad and solemn
hour of death and suffering for crime! Oh, shame, shame! What
blasphemy&mdash;what hardness of heart, and perversity of head! Detestable
and abominable folly and wickedness. Why, I say, man, if you were upon
the stage of a mountebank, performing pantomime tricks, to please and
gull the stupid populace, such a proceeding would be indecent,
indecorous, and irreligious; how much more so then, when parting from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the stage of human life, branded with crime, and condemned by the
voice of justice and the offended laws of your country! I cry shame upon
such indecency, such horrible levity, upon so solemn and so awful an
occasion as the departure of a guilty culprit (and guilty too by his own
confession) from life to eternity, to answer in another world, before an
offended God, for the crimes committed in this!"</p>

<p>"So may it plaze your Riverence, troth it was no livity at all, at all;
but merely a sort of sharp signal or freemason's sign to my comrades
that I had died intripid, and true to them, not having betrayed one of
the gang, or club, as we called it. And now once more I am alive again,
to repint anew of the same, which I most sartinly do."</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed!&mdash;Are you sure of that, Mr. Phelim O'Neale? Can I depend
upon your living word, when your dying one was false? A proof, a proof;
give me a proof, and then I shall give credence to you."</p>

<p>Phelim slowly drawing forth a watch from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>his fob: "It is here, holy
Father! this is my proof. This watch was yours, became mine by the
chance of war, or rapine, and now I restore it&mdash;it is yours again! Your
Riverence will examine it: the maker's name, your chain, your seals&mdash;you
cannot forget them any how?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I must confess that is, or was my watch; the identity of that
I cannot possibly gainsay. And if you can make out that it was you who
deprived me of it, and that now again restore it, why assuredly I shall
then confess that you are <i>certes</i> the honestest man in your calling
that I have ever met with. But, Mr. Phelim O'Neale, I have a question to
propose, and upon your answer to it will depend my credence of what now
you say. Pray, <i>if</i> (I say <i>if</i>) hanged, how were you restored to life.
A watch may be found, and a watch can be wound&mdash;may be stolen, and may
be restored, but the vital spring of life is not so easily
renovated.&mdash;Come, to the point."</p>

<p>"Your Riverence must then know, that I was cut down by my friends, and
through <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>their means restored to life, after having, to all appearance,
fallen a forfeit to the law."</p>

<p>"As how&mdash;as how? Mr. Phelim O'Neale! explain."</p>

<p>"By means of hemlock juice infused by well intentioned friends into my
throat and lungs. Oh, but too well I remember that, and but too well
they succeeded; for after the means they used for sussicitation I
recovered; but the pains which I endured were beyond those upon the
fatal tree, the punishment I had endured, and the shame I had borne, for
my family were indeed respectable. Upon my restoration to life, my
friends disguised me in female attire, and hurried me off in a merchant
vessel then in the bay, ready to slip her cables, and bound for
Virginia. So away I went in the same vessel. Och, may be it was not
without a sad and sorrowing heart that I left my mountain shores; for,
sweet Ireland, still, with all thy faults, art thou dear to me; and with
all my own too, with filial love yet do I adore thee, <i>mavourneen</i>, my
early loved, my dear natal isle!" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Phelim O'Neale continued: "Your Riverence knows the rest of my story. A
cannon shot of Marshal Rantzau's squadron soon compelled the vessel in
which I was bound for Virginia<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> immediately to strike her flag; and
the result of the Marshal's attack upon Ostind you are in full
possession of already. Here then my story ends, but not my gratitude to
you, of which, before we part, I shall endeavour to convince you of with
sincerity, marked by more than mere words."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Phelim O'Neale, you have really become eloquent, and have
astonished me quite by your display of words."</p>

<p>"No, no, Riverend Sir, they only burst forth from the heart with a full
tide of over-flowing gratitude to you, and with deep contrition to
myself, for all the past!"</p>

<p>"This my friend, my <i>honest</i> friend, (for such I now must call you,
Phelim, for the restitution which you have made by words as well as in
deeds, and I needs now must prize thee,) yes, this promises good; and
sooth to say, I am pleased withal right well. There, take my hand, and
along with it my best benison on you, your wife, and children."</p>

<p><span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has double quotes here">Phelim</span> knelt down, kissed his hand, and prayed that heaven might shower
down its choicest blessings upon his reverend head.</p>

<p>Three entire days subsequent to this confession soon passed over, and
were occupied only at intervals, in order to obviate detection, in
sawing <i>per diem</i> a bar. Each bar was cut slanting, or diagonally, so as
to be readily re-adjusted as if it had not been severed; and then the
entire bar, when replaced, was covered over by means of paper, which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was neatly pasted thereon, as if no undermining operations had been
sapping the grated barriers of their prison-house.&mdash;Meanwhile the
Reverend Chaplain was on the alert, scraping his old Cremona, and the
colonel's servant thundering forth the bass tones of his clarionet, to
serve as masqued batteries to drown the more subtle operations of the
saw and file of the son of Mars.</p>

<p>Upon the evening of the third day Phelim O'Neale came into their cell
just as the last bar to their enlargement was severed in twain. Suddenly
then all filing and fiddling, and piping and papering, at once ceased.</p>

<p>"All is right," exclaimed he, "and all is well. Before two days more
shall dawn you must away from this. I shall manage matters thus: I have
got disguises for yeez three; you, Riverend Sir, are (in the time of
travel) to be a midwife, going on a job to the town of Nieuport, three
leagues from this, where I have a friend, to whom I will address a
letter in behalf of all. In the furtherance of this my deep design, you
shall have a silk <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>gown, cap, rich gilt ear-rings, necklace, with a
large cross&mdash;all, moreover, right tawdry enough; and a Flemish hood
thrown over all, to protect Madam Needful from being sun-burnt. And, sir
soldier, there shall be a lackey's dress for you; and, to boot, I have
likewise got a horse, which your worship is to bestride, and which is to
be mounted withal with saddle and pillion, upon which latter my
lady-in-need is to ride.&mdash;And as for you, sir lackey, you shall be
caparisoned in a blue check frock of true Flanders make and hue; for
thou art to be a Flemish peasant riding withal in such brave company.
But mind, my youth, I warn thee, that with all meet, becoming respect,
thou shalt demean thyself, and ride in the rere of these gallant
personages. Three horses and a guide, when we shall fix the day and
hour, shall be found waiting at the <i>porte de Ni&egrave;uport</i>."</p>

<p>Many hearty thanks were returned for the ingenious stratagem of Mr.
Phelim O'Neale, which met with the cordial concurrence and approbation
of the prisoners.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Mr. Phelim O'Neale resumed his speech: "It must appear that yeez
all have broken prison at the time that yeez depart, so down with all
the bars when yeez go, that it may fully and fidentively appear that it
was any how without my will, knowledge, aid, abettance, or assistance,
whatsomdever, any thing at all to the contrairy notwithstanding, that
yeez fled from prison, in order that I may not suffer pains,
punishments, and penalties, from these Bellawagians, who, after all, to
do them justice, are fond of the English nation; and I verily and
fidentially believe that the craturs would sooner again fight with
Spinola Rantzau, or the d&mdash;l, nor with John Bull!"</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined Doctor M'Kenzie, "that I believe to be an undoubted
fact, inasmuch that the united states of Flanders ever have wished, if
possible, to preserve peace and amity with England, and ever sorely have
they rued the day whenever they have been forced into a war against
England."</p>

<p>"That is most true," added Colonel Davidson, "for, Reverend Sir, you
recollect <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>the favourite saying, or apothegm, of the Emperor Charles
V.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">'<i>Con todo el mundo guerra,</i><br /></div>
   <div class="verse"><i>Y puz con Ingalat jerra!</i>'<br /><br /></div>

  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">'With all the world have war,<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">But with England do not jar!'<br /><br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And while speaking of Charles, who had the magnanimity to relinquish a
throne and to retire into the monastery of Saint J&uuml;st, it must not be
forgotten the memorable declaration which he then made. While in the
monastery he employed his leisure time in works of mechanism, such as
clock-work, &amp;c.; he then exclaimed, "<i>Oh, what a fool I have
been!&mdash;during my whole reign I have endeavoured to make all my subjects
think alike in religious matters</i>, <span class="smcap">and yet I cannot cause two watches to
keep time together</span>!"</p>

<p>"Yes, noble colonel, there is my hand for that remark, and with it is
accompanied my heart! You are a Protestant and I am a Catholic, yet do I
regard you and revere you, although we differ in tenets."</p>

<p>"And there is my hand and heart in return," said the valiant <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
colonel; "and would to God that this could be a lesson to all the bigots
of the wide world, who, however, appear, I must needs confess, alas!
more zealous to frame sectarian systems, or incontinently to wage
doctrinal disputes and controversies, than meekly to disseminate <i>peace
and good will upon earth</i>! and inculcate the mild, forbearing doctrines
of Christianity, the two principal virtues of which are <i>charity</i> and
<i>humility</i>."</p>

<p>The evening of the day which succeeded that of the developement of the
projected plan of escaping from prison had arrived, when, as soon as it
had become dark, Mr. Phelim O'Neale commenced his operations by bringing
in the different dresses in which his captives were to be disguised to
facilitate their elopement; this he did gradually and cautiously,
bringing sundry articles of attire at different times, so as to escape
suspicion. Mr. Phelim recommended that when all were duly clad in their
costume of disguise, that their own clothes and changes of linen, &amp;c.
should be carefully packed up in two valises, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>one of which was to be
carried by the colonel's servant, and the other to be borne by the
guide. "And then," he added, "yeez can throw off your disguises at my
friend Malone's house, in the suburbs of Nieuport, and to whom yeez bear
a letter from me."</p>

<p>This arrangement was assented to and resolved to be acted upon <i>nemine
con</i>.</p>

<p>The trio felt exceedingly grateful to Mr. Phelim O'Neale for all the
kindness which they had received, and especially for this last very
strong proof of his great generosity. Dr. M'Kenzie especially felt
obliged to him, as he was fully sensible that it was on his account
expressly that freedom was likewise given to his fellow-sufferers.</p>

<p>"Many, very many thanks, kind-hearted Mr. Phelim, for all the favours
which you have bestowed upon us, and most particularly for this last
evincing proof. But, in sooth, we must remunerate thee for all the
expense which thou hast put thyself to upon our account."</p>

<p>Here Phelim O'Neale whispered the Reverend chaplain: "Holy Father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
I tell thee nay; for always remember that once upon a time I robbed your
Riverence upon the high-way of tin times the value of which I now
poorly endeavour to repay you, so that I must beg to hear no more at
least upon this score. I am your debtor still! Silence, firmness, and
obedience to my commands, (who am, by the powers placed in me,
commandant and generalissimo of these dark towers,) are all the
conditions that I now require or impose at your hands, and those of your
fellow-sufferers."</p>

<p>"Well, well, Phelim, I suppose it all must be so as you have advised,
and I do not gainsay it. But, I must indeed acknowledge that you are,
beyond all doubt, hesitation, or even comparison, the most honest man
whom I have ever yet met in your calling."</p>

<p>The prisoners now anxiously lay down to take some repose upon their
beds, the sheets of which had been purposely broken up, and formed into
ropes, to facilitate their descent from the gaol window, and permit
their <i>exeunt</i> to liberty."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following morning the prisoners were called up at a very early
hour by this kind-hearted gaoler, when they found themselves duly
invigorated and refreshed by a night's sound repose. And now they
hastened to put on the disguises in which they were to pursue their
journey, in the adjustment of which no great time was lost. They then
proceeded to dismantle the bars of the prison window, while the door and
outer door, upon the retirement of the gaoler, were to remain doubly
locked.</p>

<p>"Come, pray come, my gentle masters;" said Phelim O'Neale, "is all
ready?"</p>

<p>Being answered in the affirmative, he said: "Well then, any how, small
blame to me, I must give precedence to the church, then shall the sword
support the cross, and the servant attend on his master. Come, Riverend
Sir, we must now despatch&mdash;so we now proceed to business; thus before
you can patter two <i>Credos</i> or an <i>Ave</i> I will have you dangling at the
rope's end. Och, then, may be, any how, that wont be turning the tables
upon your Riverence!&mdash;ha, ha, ha! <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>But sure, any how, nothing can be
more true nor one good turn desarves another."</p>

<p>Mr. Phelim O'Neale now proceeded to lower the Reverend Chaplain by means
of the rope. Having duly adjusted all, he observed, "I say, your
Riverence, I am now paying you off in kind."</p>

<p>"Marry, Phelim, a truce now to your joke-cracking, for which, by my
halidam, I have neither will nor leisure at present to mind. So I say,
prithee, a truce to the explosion of thy witticisms, which are,
methinks, immeasurably ill-timed and chosen; so I pray reserve them for
some meeter occasion of merriment."</p>

<p>"Your Riverence, in troth, only speaks in razon; but you know, your
Riverence, that Pat can no more forego his joke at all, at all, let bide
what may, than can Justice Jokum his pun, which he cracks while the rope
is fairly cracking the neck of the victim to the laws."</p>

<p>"Well, well, Mr. Phelim, having cracked your joke, pray spare my neck
from the same, and likewise my ribs from carte and tierce, for at this
present moment I see before me, with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>terror in my mind's eye, the
retrospect of the Nieuport-gate of Ostend, and all that you have told me
thereof. So have pity upon our nerves and necks while pending in air,
and <i>depending</i> upon <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>The Reverend Doctor was now safely landed upon <i>terra firma</i>, and he in
a subdued tone gave his hearty thanks and farewell to Mr. Phelim
O'Neale, who prayed that the blessings of the poor and distressed might
ever be showered upon, and protect the Reverend Chaplain.</p>

<p>Colonel Davidson's turn now came of being manumitted from the prison
window, and while adjusting the linen cord to the lower fragment of the
window bar&mdash;"Oh, Sir Soldier! how much you remind me of a print which I
have seen at Tyrconnel Castle of the famous Hungry Kat, [Henri Quatr&eacute;,]
the famous king of France; and, och, long life to you, may you have,
like him, an angel Gabriel [meaning Gabriella d'Estrees] for a wife;
och, and your worthy honour, may she be as kind, and good, and true, as
my own humble Justin&eacute;; and moreover, besides, may you have a whole house
full of childer!" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Davidson, laughing, good humouredly protested against this part
of the benison, as he smilingly observed, that if a soldier could manage
his military baggage, he had enough to do, without being encumbered with
live stock.</p>

<p>Our adventurers having all most kindly bade adieu to Mr. Phelim O'Neale,
proceeded onwards, attended by their guide; and in about a quarter of an
hour, or so, they came up with the attendant, who was in due waiting
with the horses. Colonel Davidson most respectfully lifted up the
Reverend Chaplain, now appropriately dressed in the assumed disguise,
and who looked withal most right, grave, and matron-like, duly seated
upon the pillion destined for the journey; and fully equipped as a
livery servant the colonel mounted the saddle, and was followed by his
attending servant disguised as a Flemish peasant, who most respectfully
kept his distance in the rere, while the guide led on the van. And at a
gentle and sober trot they proceeded for the Nieuport gate, where having
arrived, and being challenged by the sentinel, and the guide giving the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
countersign, they were allowed to proceed; the draw-bridge was let down,
and onward they wended their peaceful way. Mr. Phelim O'Neale, with his
usual dexterity, had caused their horses to be shod with the shoes
turned the contrary way, with the intent thereby to prevent pursuit; by
thus puzzling the pursuers, if such should follow, that thus deceived by
the shoe-track, they should be like hounds at fault, and thus in despair
give over the pursuit.</p>

<p>Nieuport had been formerly only a hamlet, called Sandeshove, but upon
the destruction of the neighbouring port of Lombarsyde, being choked up
by the sands, a new port was constructed at Sandeshove, which caused the
town to assume the name of Nieuport, (in Latin, <i>Novus-portus</i>, or
<i>Neoportum</i>.) Lombarsyde, in consequence, was changed from a town into a
village, and Nieuport from a village into a town. It is regularly
fortified, distant about two leagues from <i>Furnes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> three <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>from
Ostend, four from Dunkirk, and seven from Brug&egrave;s and Ypres. The air of
this town is so unhealthy that the garrison do not long remain without
being relieved. It is remarkable that Nieuport is the only place
throughout Flanders that has never been taken or retaken.&mdash;"<i>Urbs
intacta manet.</i>"</p>

<p>The weather proved somewhat unpropitious to our travellers, as several
very heavy showers of rain fell during their route from Ostend to
Nieuport, the weather in Flanders being generally moist. Doctor M'Kenzie
fortunately recollected, during their progress on the road, that there
was a convent of English Carthusians established at Nieuport. This body
had been instituted in 1415, at Sheen, in England, by King Henry V.; but
in consequence of the persecutions of Queen Elizabeth, they were
compelled to depart their country; and having remained some time at
Malines and at Brug&egrave;s, they finally established themselves, <i>anno
salutis 1626</i>, at Nieuport. The monastery was situated at the western
extremity of the main street of the town, called <i>Rue de Porte
l'Orient</i>. Dr. M'Kenzie <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>had heard much praise bestowed upon the present
learned and worthy abbot, Father Philip de Comines, he resolved
therefore to make his way to the abbey, and consult with him upon the
best mode of returning to his native land. Pursuant to this
determination the wearied travellers now approached Nieuport, severely
drenched by the showers which fell during their journey. The Reverend
Gentleman threw off his female attire, and resumed his own, which was
done at a house where they halted, and situated in the suburbs of the
town, belonging to Malone, the friend of Mr. Phelim O'Neale, (to whom it
may be recollected that the latter had addressed a few lines;) at the
same time the colonel and his servant having also resumed their proper
costume, forthwith attended Doctor M'Kenzie, who proceeded to the abbey,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"where the Reverend Abbot<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">With all his convent honourably received him."</div><br /><br />
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>And not only the Reverend Clerk, but Colonel Davidson and his servant
likewise were <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>hospitably received, and kindly entertained by the
good-natured monks.</p>

<p>The next day Doctor M'Kenzie was so severely indisposed from the wetting
which he received during his journey, that it was found necessary to
call in medical aid. A slight fever seized him, which confined him for
two weeks to his bed; and when he arose he found himself so weak and
debilitated, that the physician strenuously recommended him to try the
waters of Pyrmont so soon as he should be sufficiently recovered to
undertake the journey. Finding his fellow-voyager and sufferer now
somewhat recovered, Colonel Davidson prepared to take his departure, and
having affectionately embraced the Rev. Gentleman, and cordially shaken
hands with the good abbot and his hospitable brethren, the colonel,
accompanied by his servant, proceeded to Dunkirk, where he safely
arrived after a few hours travel, and from thence it was his intention
to proceed for Holland by way of Rotterdam.</p>

<p>After a few weeks' sojourn at the Carthusian convent, where the Reverend
Chaplain <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>received every hospitality, kindness, and attention, that it
was in the power of the reverend brotherhood to bestow, with many a kind
<i>valete et benedicite</i> he departed, finding himself sufficiently strong
to endure the fatigues of a land journey. The doctor set out for
Westphalia to benefit his health by using the mineral waters of Pyrmont,
and after several days, having travelled by slow stages, he safely
reached his destination.</p>

<p>But it is now full time, indeed, that we should return to the Duchess of
Tyrconnel, and accompany that amiable lady and her highly gifted
daughter, the lovely Adelaide, in their voyage and journey; from whom
the occurrences of important political events and the fatal scenes of
war, have too long detained us, but of whom an account may be found in
the succeeding chapter.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Sad and sorrowful ever is the parting hour when beloved friends
separate, perchance never more to meet again! But oh, how sad must that
separation prove if not accompanied with the consoling hope&mdash;"we yet
shall meet again!" The Duke of Tyrconnel was then departing from his
beloved wife and darling daughter, yet no enlivening hope allayed the
feverish throbbing of his heart, with the bland promise, "we yet shall
meet <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>again!" Deep, bitter, and gloomy were the parting pangs and
presages when these affectionate friends separated, destined, perchance,
never more to meet! Still manfully the duke concealed the wound which
rankled in his breast, and with promptitude made ready to follow the
fallen fortune of his fallen master. He recommended that the duchess
should, without procrastination, depart for England, and retire thence
to the continent, until such time as the political tempest which was
raging should subside. It was also proposed that the duke and duchess
should at the same time depart for their respective destinations, and
the determination, upon the same day it was resolved on, was carried
into effect. The plan was, that the duchess, Lady Adelaide, Ladies
Letitia and Lucy, escorted by Sir Patricius Placebo, should proceed to
England, <i>vi&acirc;</i>, or rather <i>mari</i>, to Parkgate, thence journey onward to
Chester, only twelve miles distant, remain there a few days with their
kind friends Doctor Cartwright, bishop of Chester, and his lady; and
next set off for the most convenient port to embark for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>France. Thence
make a <i>detour</i> to the Netherlands, and take up their residence in the
city of Brussels, where the Duchess d'Aremberg, Adelaide's godmother,
resided.</p>

<p>The duke accompanied his family to the packet which was to convey them
from their native shores, possibly for ever! The parting scene was
exceedingly affecting, the duchess, rallying all her fortitude, was
enabled to address the duke ere they fondly embraced and parted, in
these empassioned words:&mdash;"Go forth, my dear lord!" said the duchess.
"Go, my beloved lord, where every filial tie calls your attendance,
where glory, your country, and your king, demand your presence. Go, and
the god of battles be your guide and guard! But the wife of Tyrconnel
breathes no sigh&mdash;the wife of Tyrconnel sheds no tear at her loved
lord's departure. Had he remained ingloriously at home then there would
have been too ample cause for lamentation; the blush of every feeling
cheek, and the throb of every manly heart, would have revolted at
conduct so base and selfish. But, thank heaven, this is not&mdash;it could
not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>be! Go forth then, my dearest lord, and the blessings of a wife and
of a mother ever attend thee!"</p>

<p>Adelaide, however, could not command those feelings which were
instinctive to her sensitive feelings, she sobbed and wept deep and
bitterly; she endeavoured to check the rooted sorrow which was preying
on her heart, but the attempt was all in vain, her affection burst forth
more strongly from her endeavour to counteract it; and tears of sorrow
for her father's departure flowed in deep succession. The duke was
highly affected with this parting scene; yet sternly checking himself,
he said:&mdash;"My dearest Adelaide this must not be; virtue carried to
excess&mdash;honour carried to excess, lose all their original intrinsic
worth. Nay, even religion may be transmuted into persecution; and
eternal silence and seclusion from the world be considered as its divine
attributes, so that each shall lose all the original stamp of their
native worth. I therefore tell you, my dearest daughter, that this must
not be; I shall, with the permission of divine providence, so soon as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>shall be in my power, rejoin you all in a foreign land upon my return
from attending my revered monarch to Saint Germains. And, my beloved,
although we shall have lost our rank, and reside as persons quite
unknown&mdash;perhaps wholly unnoticed; yet, my dearest Adelaide, we shall
nevertheless retain that which is much dearer to the human breast,
self-esteem, and social love, and social leisure, and these undisturbed
by courtly crowds, unchanged by time or circumstance, or loss of power.
These social ties too well I know, my dearest child, are dearer to thee
than wealth, rank, pomp, and power; and believe me truly we shall feel
far happier than ever we felt before. So I pray thee, dearest Adelaide,
that we may have no more of sorrow or repining, for all will yet be
well!"</p>

<p>The duke affectionately embraced his duchess, Adelaide, and his sisters,
and cordially shook hands with Sir Patricius Placebo; when having
descended the side of the vessel, his Grace jumpt into the boat which
conveyed him to the shore, and entered his carriage which waited for
him, to attend upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>the fallen fortunes of his fallen master. When
intimation was given to Sir Patricius that he was to proceed to England,
and take charge of the duchess and family, <i>certes</i> he received the
communication not without some portion of surprise, and of pleasure too
we must admit: "<i>Jacta est alea, jacta est alea!</i>" he exclaimed: "The
dye is thrown, so now 'For England Ho!' ha, ha, ha! As Prince Hamlet
says in the play, 'For England Ho!' ehem!&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">DOSS MOI, TANE STIGMEN!"</p>

<p>The packet, with all her canvass unfurled, and proudly swelling before a
brisk and favouring breeze, promptly set sail onward in her direct
course for the seaport of Parkgate,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> in Cheshire. The day was
uncommonly fine, and a warm exhilarating summer sun refulgently shone <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
forth, richly gilding the expanding sails of the vessel, and with its
genial enlivening rays cheering the voyagers, who sat beneath an awning
upon the deck. By this time Adelaide, pursuant to the monitory parting
injunctions of her father, had become tranquil and composed. While
receding from the beloved shores of her native land, Adelaide was
particularly struck with the romantic headlands and mountains that,
south and north, bounded the horizon&mdash;the romantic peninsula of Howth,
the hoary promontory of Wicklow-head, the conic hills "the
Sugar-loaves," so denominated from their peculiar conformation; the long
continuous chain of the Dublin and Wicklow mountains which adorned the
southern point of the horizon, while anon they melted into distant
a&euml;rial perspective. Adelaide was at once charmed and delighted with the
scene, which called forth from her pen the following effusion:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">TO HOPE.</p>

</div>

<p>Little of interest, and still less of variety, the reader can reasonably
expect to have narrated in a short sea-voyage from the shores of Erin to
those of Albion; but on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>contrary, much tameness, much sameness, and
much monotony, must necessarily be encountered by the voyager.</p>

<p>However, the breeze blew propitious, the weather smiled a settled and
serene summer day; the resplendent azure of the sky was unruffled by a
cloud, the sun was warm, and the scene proved genial and exhilarating,
as onward the gallant bark ploughed her watery way.</p>

<p>A numerous host of seagulls circled in many a merry gambol around the
vessel, then right-joyously plunged into the water, and boomed upon the
billow, while they seemed to rejoice in the summer sun, and sport on
halcyon tide; while ever and anon the Diver (<i>Colymbus Troile</i>) plunged
beneath the glassy surface of the sea; a large flock of <i>Terns</i>, or
sea-swallows (<i>sterna hirundo</i>) congregated about the vessel, flying
around in quick and circling evolutions; now rising from, now sinking in
the deep, in frolic play, then gliding along close to the surface of the
sea; sometimes snapping at the insects in their way, or then suddenly
checking their course, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>they were seen to dart down upon their finny
prey, which was swallowed in the ascent, without the operation by any
means retarding the progress of their flight.</p>

<p>The gallant vessel throughout the entire day had joyously scudded onward
in a prosperous course before the favouring breeze, and in no longer
space than fifteen hours from her departure from the port of Dublin, had
arrived at the mouth of the river Dee. But the tide was at this time at
ebb, which of necessity retarded the landing of the passengers, as
likewise from other co-operating difficulties, the dangerous sand-banks
which blockade this harbour, and above all, the total <i>deficit</i> of deep
water, a difficulty not to be surmounted, left no choice whatever to the
captain but to cast anchor, and cause the packet to remain at her
moorings to await the morning tide, which, consequently, put the
patience of the voyagers much to task.</p>

<p>The passengers paced the deck to and fro, while they amused themselves
with whatever object caught their eye, ear, or fancy; the operations of
the crew, the passing sail, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>darkening cloud, the sea-fowl retiring
to rest, or the slow and hollow murmurs of the receding wave as it
foamed, while it retreated, from the adjoining sands of the winding Dee.</p>

<p>At this time the passengers became highly and deeply interested by
seeing, or imagining that they saw, human beings upon one of the distant
sand-banks, whom the returning tide inevitably would destroy. The
telescope was put in requisition, and this only confirmed their fears;
for in the days we mention, no Dollond, no Ramsden, was in existence; of
course the lenses were dim and defective, and objects, instead of being
duly reflected, were misrepresented to the eye. From the repeated
remonstrances and apprehensions of the passengers the jolly-boat was
lowered into the water, the boatmen briskly plyed the oar, and soon
reached Dee's yellow sands. When lo! those whom they had come to rescue,
as they imagined, from a watery grave, suddenly took wing, and flew
away!<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Yes, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>gentle reader, too true it is; for the objects which had
attracted the attention and the sympathy of the passengers were no more
nor less than a large company of cormorants,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who somewhat hungry no
doubt, had been busily fishing for their supper, and were at the moment
they were disturbed by the approach of the boat, in the very overt act
of despatching their meal upon the banks of the Dee, who thus suddenly
took flight, croaking in hoarse, hollow, and discordant shrieks, their
disappointment at being interrupted from their evening banquet; for
these stern, sullen, and circumspect plunderers, are most greedy and
insatiate gluttons. The great Milton, in his immortal poem, finishes the
sketch of this unrelenting tyrant, by causing Satan to personate the
corvorant,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> while envying the happiness of our first parents, as
undelighted he surveyed the beauties of Paradise. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is now full time to say that a calm night succeeded the tranquil
day of our fair heroine's voyage, that the duchess and all the party
enjoyed a most refreshing night's repose. Upon the return of the tide
the raising of the anchors and unfurling of the sails awoke the
passengers, who accordingly arose, and ascended the deck. The morning
was most lovely; it was then between seven and eight o'clock, the tide
was full in, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>brilliantly shone forth a July sun, whose cheering
beams illumined the sea and all the surrounding scenery. The vessel was
once more under weigh, they crossed the bar of Chester; and in less than
an hour and a half they were at anchor off Parkgate. The long boat was
put out, and our heroine for the first time trod upon English ground. An
excellent breakfast was prepared for the voyagers at "The Welch Harp,"
and very soon smoked upon the board. The carriages and horses of the
noble personages were landed in the space of about two hours' time, in
perfect safety; for at this period seamen were not so experienced in the
tackle and machinery necessary for this purpose as they are in our own
days.</p>

<p>When breakfast was concluded the noble party sauntered along the
sea-shore, and Sir Patricius having proposed to them a walk along the
pathway to the very beautifully situated and retired village of Neston,
and the proposal having met with universal approbation, was soon carried
into effect. And upon return the thanks of the noble party <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>were voted,
<i>viva voce</i>, to Sir Patricius, without one dissentient <i>no!</i></p>

<p>Upon their return the travelling carriages were all duly paraded in
harnessed array before the door of the inn, and ready for the road,
which however, by the bye, proved to be none of the best. In a short
time the distinguished travellers started, but the journey, although in
distance not more than ten miles, ended in a long and fatiguing one from
the badness of the road, and the delay consequent thereon; the first
three or four miles were over deep sands, and the remainder of the way
was over a rough and badly paved road, which continued without
intermission until they reached the gates of ancient Chester. Sir
Patricius stoutly insisted that this road had been paved by the Romans,
and reminded him, he observed, strongly of the <i>Via Appia</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which is
noticed by Horace. "Ah!" said he, "in achieving victories, in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>forming
camps, and making of roads and cheese, the Romans were a great people
indeed!"</p>

<p>The ladies complained of fatigue, having been much shaken and jolted on
their tiresome journey; but Sir Patricius Placebo solemnly averred, that
the only effect which he had experienced was, that it had strongly
created in him a most immoderate hunger, excited, no doubt, as he
supposed it had been, by the heat and action of shaking, jolting, &amp;c.;
all which keenly operating upon the gastric juice, withal had acted with
such an impetus and energy, to which, in sooth, he was wholly
unaccustomed, had, he was free and honest to confess, called forth so
very unexpected a craving for food! But Sir Patricius was ever upon the
<i>qui viv&eacute;</i>, and was sure warily to be provided with a pretext, like
proverb-loving Sancho, whenever he wished that a <i>deje&ucirc;n&egrave; a l&aacute;
fourchette</i>, or a collation, should be put in requisition.</p>

<p>The noble party were set down at the noted and far-famed "White Lion,"
where compassionating the <i>fames Canina</i> under which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>poor Sir Patricius
languished, a cold collation was called for, where, amid various meats
and pastries, a cold and excellent pigeon-pie attracted his hungry
attention, and ere long the contents thereof suddenly disappeared, and
then he seemed to be relieved from the evident distress under which he
had incontinently laboured. This operation was promptly succeeded by a
liberal libation (as a salutary condiment to the pigeon-pie) of some
excellent old Hock, the <i>anno domini</i> of which was unknown to honest
Boniface of "the White Lion."</p>

<p>The ladies too were induced to take some slight refreshment; when the
baronet, who now seemed himself again, proposed a walk to the ladies,
which he thought would both please and refresh them; and that which he
selected was around the walls of this ancient and singular city. This
proposition being readily acceded to, the party set forth upon their
intended peregrination.</p>

<p>Sir Patricius seemed to be more inclined to the talking mood than he had
been disposed to previous to the collation; and made <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>several very
apposite remarks during the progress of their walk, which were
particularly addressed to the duchess.</p>

<p>"This truly ancient, venerable city, was called by the Romans, <i>Colonia
Deva</i>, or <i>Devana</i>, from its having been the station of the <span class="smcap-all">XX</span>th
Victorious Legion. It is evident that <i>Deva</i> means</p>

<p class="center">"The ancient hallow'd Dee."</p>

<p>"<i>This city without parallel</i> is of Roman origin, as is fully evinced by
the form of the city, which is completely Roman, being constructed in
the peculiar figure which the Romans always preserved in their stations
or castrametations, wheresoever the nature of the ground would permit.
The plan or figure of this city is a peculiar one; in shape it is
quadrangular, with four principal gates leading to the four principal
streets, which run directly from east to west, and north to south;
besides a variety of lesser ones, all crossing each other at right
angles, so as to divide the whole into lesser squares. The form likewise
of the walls is also Roman, which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>are the only entire specimen of
ancient fortification now in great Britain. The walls, as you may
perceive, are in many parts, especially on the north and east sides,
guarded by towers placed in such a position as not to be beyond bow-shot
of one another, in order that the archers might reach the enemy who
attempted to attack the intervals. They also are mostly of a round form,
as was recommended by the Roman architects, in order the better to elude
the force of catapulta and battering-rams."</p>

<p>Here Sir Patricius (in which we shall not follow him) delivered a very
erudite antiquarian lecture upon salient angles, action and reaction,
salient towers, <i>propugnaculi</i>, and the whole range of Roman military
architecture.</p>

<p>He next observed: "Chester is a city and county of itself; the Dee river
half encircles it by a winding curve, flowing from east to west, where,
nearly at about twenty miles distance in its course, it empties itself
into the Irish channel. Look down, my lady Duchess, from these walls,
upon the objects <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>below, and you will then appreciate their great
height. Originally they were constructed for defence, but they are now
converted into a promenade for the health and recreation of the
inhabitants; and indeed I must do them the justice to say, that they
keep them in excellent repair. The walls are so narrow in some
particular places that only two persons, as you must observe, can walk
abreast. The circumference of the walls extends to one mile
three-quarters, and a hundred and one yards, ehem! <i>be the same more or
less</i>, as the gentlemen of the long robe might express it."</p>

<p>In their progress around the walls, the ladies all were highly pleased
by the surrounding scenery, and none more so than the Lady Adelaide:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How beautiful are the views from several parts of these venerable
walls! How luxuriantly green the pastures that margin these walls, and
that beautiful spot, the race-course!"</p>

<p>"Which, my lady," rejoined Sir Patricius, "they now call popularly
Roodee, but the orthography is Rood-eye.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This beautiful pasture <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
ground belongs to the corporation, and comprises eighty-four acres.
Yonder are the mountains of Flintshire and Derbyshire; there the hills
of Broxton; while the insulated rock of Beeston, crowned with its
romantic castle, forms the background of the picture upon which your
Ladyship seems to gaze with such delight; while the landscape is still
further enlivened by the devious winding of the Dee, in its majestic
circling course to Boughton."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>While walking around the walls of Chester, the duchess and her party
encountered a handsome young stranger, who was also promenading this
frequented walk.&mdash;We have already premised the narrowness of the walls,
that they in some parts only admitted two persons to walk abreast.&mdash;The
stranger, to make way, retired to a small recess nigh one of the towers,
and courteously bowed as the party passed onward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p><p>His eyes were deeply rivetted upon the Lady Adelaide, while her's
seemed as intently fixed upon him. Thrice during their walk, in a
similar manner, they encountered the stranger; at the last meeting it so
happened that Adelaide (accidentally, no doubt,) dropped her glove just
as the stranger met her; he raised it from the ground, and in the most
courteous and graceful manner restored it. While in the act of returning
the glove to its fair owner, it so happened that his hand touched her's;
instantly the blood mounted to her cheek, and she deeply blushed; but
sweetly smiling, she politely thanked him, made her obeisance, and
passed on.</p>

<p>"Who can this stranger be?" thought Adelaide to herself. "He is surely
no ordinary being&mdash;none of the common-place creatures of this earth. And
oh, his fine manly beautiful countenance that seems born to command!"</p>

<p>Then, with a sigh, "she thought too that he looked likewise as if born
to love. Oh, what I would give (just from mere curiosity!) to know his
name and rank;&mdash;there can be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>no doubt but that he must be a person of
distinction."</p>

<p>After this mental soliloquy she hastened to rejoin the duchess and her
aunts. They all now returned to "the White Lion;" and the next day was
to be devoted to their visit to the episcopal palace, to pay their
respects to the Bishop of Chester and Mrs. Cartwright. The evening
proving remarkably fine, Sir Patricius ventured to propose a walk to the
ladies, to view the interior of the city, the shops, "the rows," &amp;c. As
they passed along, they observed that many of the houses were of wood,
and most of them built of brick, and wooden frame-work, alternately
painted black and white, in certainly a most coffin-like fashion. The
pinnacles and gables, they observed, were adorned with various curious
and grotesque carvings. Sir Patricius seemed now very anxious to display
all his gothic lore.</p>

<p>"This, my Lady Duchess," he observed, "is in verity a most ancient,
venerable city; and perhaps the most striking of the many peculiarities
in which it abounds are these remarkable covered galleries, or, as they <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
are ycleped, 'Rows,' which extend the entire length on each side of many
of the streets in front of the range of shops, which are covered over
head, and you ascend them from the four principal streets by flights of
stairs. The effect is as if the front room in every first floor was
scooped out, and the upper stories of the premises supported on pillars,
while the lower tier of rooms, thus purloined, are occupied as shops.
The space thus scooped out forms a covered gallery on each side of the
street, with a ballustrade or railing in front, over which various goods
are flung for exposure to the public&mdash;namely, silks, stuffs, shawls, &amp;c.
This ballustrade faces the street; the back parlours of each house thus
circumstanced are converted into rows of shops, and are a great
convenience to the public, from the facility of passing from street to
street, effectually secured from rain or heat, affording a sheltered
walk in winter and a shady one in summer to both inhabitants and
strangers. The streets had been excavated out of the earth, and are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>in
many places several feet below the surface. The carriages drive far
below the levels of the kitchens, on a line with the range of shops.</p>

<p>"There can be no question, my Lady, whatever," added Sir Patricius,
looking very knowingly, and taking with much gravity a pinch of snuff
from his Carolus snuff-box, "there can be no doubt," said he, "but that
these 'rows' are precisely the same as the ancient <i>vestibules</i>, and
appear evidently to have been a form of building preserved from the time
that this city was possessed by the Romans. These <i>vestibules</i> were
built before the doors, midway between the streets and the houses, and
were the places where dependants waited for the coming forth of their
patrons, and under which they might walk, and pass away the tedious
minutes of expectation. Plautus, in the third act of his <i>Mostellaria</i>,
describes both their situation and their use,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> namely, that the
vestibule in front of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>the house answered the purpose of a piazza, or
covered gallery. The shops beneath these 'rows' were certainly the
<i>crypt&aelig;</i> and <i>apothec&aelig;</i>, the magazines and repositories for the various
necessaries of the owners of the houses."</p>

<p>The party had now descended from the rows, and pursued their route under
one of the arched gateways ascending from the walls, when who should at
this time be seen but the youthful stranger whom they had encountered in
their morning walk. He took off his hat and lowly bowed. Adelaide,
blushing, returned the salute, being the only one of the party who had
caught a glimpse of him&mdash;the duchess and her sisters listening in
wonderment at the learned lore which Sir Patricius had displayed and
poured forth with such wondrous volubility; and he was himself, in
sooth, too much occupied by his own eloquence, to see, to hear, to think
of ought but old Plautus, the <i>Colonia Devana</i>, and the Roman
centurions!</p>

<p>The duchess and her party having returned to "the White Lion," tea was
immediately ordered; and as Sir Patricius had most ably done his part <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
at the morning collation as well as at dinner, he thought it only
decorous to go supperless to bed, which deficit he was, however,
resolved to make up from the supplies of the tea-table. They all shortly
retired to rest, the ladies complaining that they had not as yet got the
tossing of the vessel from their heads, nor the shaking of the Roman
paved way from their shoulders.</p>

<p>"After all," said Sir Patricius, "however, commend me the Romans,
whether for their armies, their victories, for making roads, or
manufacturing cheese!"</p>

<p>The duchess took this as the signal for departing, aware that if this
topic were once begun, it would prove no easy matter to stop Sir
Patricius in his eulogium on the Romans.</p>

<p>The next day, at meet season and time, the duchess, attended by her
party, drove to the episcopal palace, and found the bishop and his lady
at home, expecting their arrival. But it is necessary that the reader
should be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>previously introduced to the bishop and his lady.</p>

<p>The Right Reverend Doctor Cartwright, Lord Bishop of Chester, was in the
sixty-first or second year of his age, and having passed by the sunny
side of his sexagesimal year, was verging fast to his grand climacteric;
he enjoyed a strong and healthy old age. Piety was stamped on his fine
expanded brow, and benevolence and good-humour sparkled in his eyes, and
played upon his lips; his eyes were hazel, large and intelligent,
beaming beneath his deep black eye-brows; his nose was aquiline; his
figure tall and graceful. He wore a black camlet riding-coat; his hat
was of the episcopal fashion; his peruke was bushy and well powdered;
and in his right hand he carried an ivory-headed cane, not from
necessity, but from choice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cartwright was somewhat further advanced in years than her Right
Reverend Lord. She had never, even in youth, been accounted handsome;
however, the expression of her countenance was pleasing, and accompanied
withal by a liveliness and good-humour, approaching somewhat the <i>vis <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
comica</i>, but in no way allied to the satirical. Mrs. Cartwright was a
plain, honest, excellent woman, possessed of a good understanding, and
considered in those times as being well informed. No heart was ever
found more fond of doing a kind, generous, and benevolent act, many of
which are on record; but this was none of her seeking, as no one
disliked ostentation more than what she did; her desire was to do good
without its being promulgated. The bishop and his lady never had any
children, but they were too wise and grateful to make themselves
miserable upon this account, and lived contented and happy upon those
blessings which providence had bounteously bestowed, without vainly and
impiously repining for what they never had possessed. Loving and
beloved, this couple lived mated and matched, regarded and respected by
all ranks and conditions in society. They were never weary of
well-doing; daily acts of charity, hospitality, generosity, and
kindness, emanated from the kind and excellent feelings congenial to
them <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>both; indeed they fully verified the words of the inspired
Psalmist: "The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the
righteous."</p>

<p>Such were the Bishop of Chester and his lady, to whom the duchess and
her train now presented themselves, and by whom they were most warmly
and affectionately received.</p>

<p>"Welcome! most heartily welcome, my good, excellent, worthy Lady
Duchess," exclaimed the bishop, warmly taking her Grace by the hand; at
the same moment almost she was cordially embraced by Mrs. Cartwright.</p>

<p>"A kind and warm welcome to you and yours," continued the bishop. Then
looking intently at Adelaide, he pressed warmly her hand, saying to the
duchess, "Beshrew my heart, but, lady, thy daughter is most passing
fair, exceeding fair; nor hath fame in aught out-heralded the Lady
Adelaide's beauty!"</p>

<p>The duchess made a low courtesy, and thanked his lordship for his polite
gallantry. "But," said the duchess in an under tone, "when, my Lord, you
shall know more of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>my daughter, I trust that you will like her mind
better then than now you like her visage." Next, aloud, her Grace said,
"My daughter has reason, my lord, to be proud of your praise, for
<i>laudari a laudato</i>&mdash;your lordship knows the rest."</p>

<p>"No, my Lady Duchess, no! I am no orator, and, I thank God, no
politician! I am no great man, albeit I am a peer spiritual, and so
forth; therefore my praise on that score can be of but little value
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Not so, my Lord, the praise of a good man ever is of value."</p>

<p>The bishop bowed. His Lordship next proposed a walk in his garden; and
then they adjourned to Chester walls, which closely adjoin the palace,
to promenade until dinner. Adelaide looked to the left and right, but
"the unknown knight of Chester walls" was not to be seen. Upon their
return to the episcopal palace dinner was ready, and soon smoked upon
the hospitable board. It was a sumptuous entertainment. The bishop
having helped the ladies, soon discovered <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>that Sir Patricius was in
complete possession of the <i>scavoir vivre</i>.</p>

<p>"I warmly recommend you; Sir Placebo&mdash;Sir Patricius, I beg your
pardon&mdash;to have some Severn salmon, or some choice dories, caught in the
Llyn; and I do think, above all, that I can speak in positive
commendation of some stewed carp, which is truly delicious. I saw them
caught yesterday (for I am fond of fishing) in that <i>Piscosus amnis</i>,
which we call the Vyrnyn."</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, I thank you, I have just made a grand assault, <i>vi et
furca</i>, upon your venison, which is actually the finest I have ever
enjoyed. The lean is so ruddy and the fat is so white, that I think, my
Lord, I shall just try a <i>modicum</i> more, [the fourth time he was
helped!] and some sweet sauce withal!"</p>

<p>Indeed the opinion and "great capabilities," to use his own phrase, of
Sir Patricius Placebo, at a well-chosen dinner, were never yet, even by
his enemies, considered as apocryphal; and in the culinary calendar this
notable day was deserving of a mark of approbation, and should be held
in savoury remembrance by every follower of Epicurus. The first and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
second course removed, cheese was put down, to which Sir Patricius
helped himself liberally.</p>

<p>"My Lord, your Cheshire is positively excellent. We are indebted to the
victorious <i>Colonia Devana</i> for it. To these same Roman centurions who
introduced the art of cheese-making, until then unknown in England, into
Cheshire; and for my part, my Lord; to adventure upon a pun, I would
call this admirable cheese <i>divina</i>.&mdash;Ha, ha, ha! It is every way
deserving of the <i>Cret&acirc; notanda</i> of Horace, or the <i>Cret&acirc; notare</i> of
Persius: it should truly be marked with white chalk in the calendar!"</p>

<p>"It seems, Sir Patricius, that you are disposed to <i>chalk your cheese</i>
with a note of admiration!&mdash;eh? Ha, ha, ha. However, I certainly agree
with you that the art of cheese-making to be the most valuable memorial
which the Romans have left us, and in an especial manner to this
country. Indeed so extensively was cheese-making carried on that these
cohorts exported large quantities of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>cheese, not only to the distant
colonies, but even to imperial Rome herself!"</p>

<p>"Most true, my Lord; and to such perfection has it been brought, that it
is now (<i>me judice</i>) far superior to any imported from classic Italy, or
dull, plodding Batavia. Centuries have passed by, and Rome's centurions
have mixed their dust with the defunct C&aelig;sars, but Cheshire cheese still
holds its high estimation; and long may it do so, while British palates,
teeth, and taste remain&mdash;<i>Semperque manebit!</i>"</p>

<p>A magnificent <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has desert">dessert,</span> crowned with the oldest and choicest wines,
concluded this princely banquet, and each day's entertainment, although
varied, was equally as splendid as the feast we have recorded.</p>

<p>The next day being the sabbath day, all the guests accompanied Mrs.
Cartwright to the cathedral, (where the bishop was to preach) and sat in
that lady's seat in the gallery. As soon as the service was over the
party proceeded to inspect this grand and venerable pile.</p>

<p>"The cathedral of Chester was built," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>as the bishop informed the
duchess, "during the reigns of Henry VI., VII., VIII." He observed that
there was much to admire in the beautiful west end of the nave. "The
window over the door is richly adorned with much tasteful tracery, and
architrave of the door enriched with figures and other subjects in
sculpture. The choir is considered handsome, and the gothic tabernacle
work over the stalls is carved in a light and elegant manner. The arches
in the galleries are divided by slender pillars of admirable
conformation."</p>

<p>His Lordship then came to the bishop's throne, which he pointed out as
standing on a stone base; and he observed that the form was an oblong
square, or parallelogram, which was remarkable for its sculpture, each
side being richly ornamented with gothic carvings, with arches and
pinnacles. Around the upper part of the canopy stands a range of little
images, designed to represent the kings and saints of the Mercian
kingdom. The party now advanced to the chancel, where there are four
stone stalls for the officiating priests, richly ornamented above with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
carved gothic work. The duchess and Lady Adelaide particularly admired
the magnificent piece of tapestry which adorns the altar; it represents
Elmias the sorcerer struck blind by Saint Paul. The design is taken from
one of the cartoons of Raffaelle, and the execution is truly admirable.</p>

<p>The bishop and his noble guests returned to the palace, where a
magnificent dinner was prepared for them, and the bishop entertained Sir
Patricius Placebo, so soon as the ladies retired, with "<i>A brief and
succinct account</i>," as his lordship termed it, "of the ecclesiastical
state of the ancient city of Chester." But as two flasks of old Burgundy
disappeared during the narration, we are somewhat apprehensive that it
would prove rather heavy on our reader's hands, and therefore we shall
in <i>toto</i> decline the discussion.</p>

<p>The duchess and her family having very pleasantly passed a week at the
palace, now prepared for their regretted departure, and next sadly to
bid an affectionate farewell. Mrs. Cartwright obtained a promise from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>the duchess of writing to her as soon as her Grace should reach either
Amiens or Lille. They proceeded to the town of Tarporly, and thence to
Wrexam, where they stopped to change horses and to take some
refreshment.</p>

<p>Wrexam is the largest town in North Wales, and its parish the most
numerous; it is the principal town of Denbighshire. Struck by the beauty
and airy lightness of the lofty tower of Wrexam church, the duchess and
Lady Adelaide resolved, while the necessary operations at the inn were
going forward, to wend their way to visit this fine gothic pile; and Sir
Patricius, "albeit," as he said himself pleasantly enough upon the
occasion, "although he was much more addicted, he must needs confess, to
the <i>memento vivere</i> than the <i>memento mori</i>" yet, nevertheless, right
gallantly esquired the ladies.</p>

<p>"The church of Wrexam is the glory not only of the place, but of North
Wales." The inside of the church is very spacious, and consists of a
nave, two aisles, and a chancel. Much grotesque carving surmounts the
capitals of the various pillars in the nave, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>and within the arches are
placed many armorial bearings of the ancient British and Saxon princes.
Many of the monuments which adorn the nave and the aisles are admirably
designed, and the sculpture exceedingly fine. The epitaphs are numerous
and curious: many a "<i>hic jacet</i> Ap-Howel&mdash;Ap-Morgan&mdash;Ap-Jhones," may be
found in the church and in the church-yard. On the outside of the church
is placed a great variety of ludicrous and grotesque sculpture. The
steeple is an extremely handsome tower, richly ornamented on three sides
with rows of saints placed in rich gothic niches. Among the group is
that of Saint Giles, the patron saint of the church, with the hind that
so miraculously nourished him in the desert, as monkish legends tell. At
every angle of the church tower is a light turret, with a winding
stair-case, twenty-four feet high. The entire height of the church
tower, which is seen to a considerable distance, is one hundred and
twenty-five feet. The church was built in the reign of Henry VIII., and
is in the florid style of gothic architecture.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Know, gentle reader, that there occurred a little incident in Wrexam
church, which must needs have the additament of being known unto thee.
When the noble travellers entered the nave they were much struck by
beholding a robin perched upon a brass chandelier, which was suspended
from the ceiling in the nave, opposite to the reading-desk. The minister
was engaged in reading the Psalms, the clerk the responses; and the
robin expanding his wings, and straining his little throat, as if to
overpower and surpass their voices conjoined. The congregation consisted
of but three elderly ladies. It was of a week day, to which
circumstance, in all probability, was to be attributed the paucity of
the congregation.</p>

<p>This little occurrence produced the following lines from the pen of Lady
Adelaide:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">LETTER FROM THE DUCHESS OF TYRCONNEL,</p>

<p class="center">ADDRESSED</p>


<blockquote><p>"TO MY DEAR AND INTRINSICALLY ESTEEMED FRIEND, MRS. CARTWRIGHT, AT THE
EPISCOPAL PALACE OF CHESTER."</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="margin-left:30em"><i>Dated</i>, Lille, <i>August 12th</i>, 169&mdash;<br /></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"I now most willingly take up my pen to give you, my dear Madam, some
account of our voyage, and also of our journey, in fulfilment of the
promise which I made in parting from you and the worthy prelate at
Chester palace:&mdash;</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"Well, we proceeded on our route to Bristol, where, you are aware, it
was our intention to have embarked for some safe port in France; at
Bristol in due course we arrived, <i>sans</i> accident and <i>sans</i> adventure
of any kind. But, lo and behold, we could find no vessel destined for
the fair shores of France! What was next to be done? why we set off, <i>au
d&egrave;sespoir</i>, for Dover. When we arrived at that seaport Sir Patricius
made instant inquiries for a packet, and was told that there was then
only one on the station, and that too was engaged. As he was retiring
from the beach who should he meet, think you? why none other than 'the
unknown knight' whom we had so often encountered on the walls of
Chester; this, you will freely admit, was rather somewhat extraordinary,
if not marvellous, certainly. Well, my dear Mrs. Cartwright, an
explanation took place, when this singular 'knight unknown' informed Sir
Patricius that he himself had engaged the packet, but that it was
exclusively at our service; and in the politest and most obliging manner
he relinquished it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>to us, and was so truly chivalrous as wholly to
decline a passage for himself.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"This was indeed nobly kind and generous, and we all felt it as such. At
our embarkation the graceful, interesting 'knight unknown' was on the
pier of Dover, and you never saw, my dear friend, with what a dignified
grace this <i>pre&ugrave;x</i> chevalier handed us all on board, and how graciously
he bade us 'adieu.' My dear enthusiastic Adelaide is still further
convinced that he must be a prince <i>incognito</i>. He said, as we were
about to part, 'I understand that your Grace and family are now
departing on your way to Brussels.'</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"I nodded assent. 'Shall we, pray, stand any chance,' I inquired, 'of
seeing you, Sir, in that ancient city?'</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"The stranger hesitated. '<i>Perhaps</i>,' quoth he, 'my Lady Duchess.'</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Oh, if then you were to have seen the indignant glance that Lady
Letitia flung on the courteous stranger, while it would seem
involuntarily she echoed, or rather screamed, '<i>perhaps!</i>' For you must
know that to this <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>adverb the Lady Letitia hath, and entertains an
entire, instinctive, and unconquerable detestation, to the very
extinction, I verily credit, of every other given adverb in English
grammar, be it <i>aye</i>, or be it <i>no</i>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"'But,' continued the gallant stranger, 'I yet may speak in more decided
terms. It is my full determination to proceed to Brussels, unless ought
unforeseen and unexpected should arise to prevent it. I most
respectfully and sincerely wish your Grace and friends every prosperity,
a safe and expeditious voyage, and a pleasant journey.'</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Then bowing with all the grace of one who had been familiar with
courts, he took off his hat, which he several times waved on high, until
the packet got under weigh. I could not but observe that when he took
Adelaide by the hand to lead her on board, that my daughter coloured
most deeply. Indeed I cannot but apprehend that an <i>impression</i> has been
made on her young and feeling heart. But this is <i>entr&egrave; nous</i>. Is it not
most strange, and does it not look exceedingly like <i>love at first
sight</i>? But who can be 'the <i>unknown</i> knight' of Chester walls? I can <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
form no opinion, but I am not certainly inclined to agree with Adelaide
that he is a prince <i>incognito</i>.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"But to resume my narrative:&mdash;We embarked at Dover on Friday morning, at
eight o'clock, on board a neutral vessel bound for Calais; it was a
Flemish packet, named <i>De Zee-Schilpad</i>, Captain Bulderende master. The
weather when we left Dover was fine, but the breeze soon became squally,
attended with heavy rain, and a rough and swelling sea; but in the event
our passage proved a good one. Many of the sailors were Flemish, and
some were French; and, I must say, the most lubberly and awkward I had
ever beheld, <i>p&agrave;r exampl&eacute;</i>, one of them sat down to haul a <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has robe">rope!</span> So that
really we felt far more indebted to the wind and waves than to the
nautical skill of either French or Flemish sailors. And I must own, and
am quite free to confess, that their inferiority to our own gallant
tars, in verity, did not displease me.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Calais, as we approached it, is seen to much advantage, the spire of
<i>Notre Dame</i>, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>and the turrets of the <i>Maison de Ville</i> nobly arising
over the waves, have certainly a fine and imposing effect; it is indeed
a neat and handsome town; the harbour presents a pleasant and enlivening
scene, and is defended by many forts. The citadel is strongly fortified,
and the city surrounded with walls, gates, &amp;c. The parish church was
built by the English, and has been much admired for its architecture.
The fishery here for herrings and mackerel is considerable, and of both
kinds we partook with much <i>go&ucirc;t</i> during our short sojourn in that
ancient city.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"You know what an incurable enthusiast my Adelaide is. During the entire
progress of our voyage, which occupied some five hours, the whole way
from Dover to Calais Adelaide sat on deck, and could not be prevailed
upon, by any persuasion or entreaty whatever, to descend into our cabin,
although the wind, which was fair, blew also fresh, and accompanied with
some showers; still stationed on deck sat Adelaide, intently gazing upon
the Shakespeare-cliffs,</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">"From the dread summit of this chalky bourn;<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Look up a height ... the shrill gorg'd lark so far<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Cannot be seen or heard:&mdash;do but look up!"<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"So intently did Adelaide gaze, that one would have thought that the
spell-bound charm that fascinated her looks to those lofty cliffs, could
only be broken and dispelled by the wand of the enchanter. The following
quatrain is my Adelaide's:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">Ye chalky cliffs! unchang'd ye stand,<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">As pencil'd by great Shakespeare's hand;<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Still to the clouds your summits rise,<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Nor perish until nature dies!<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<blockquote><p>"Never once changing her position on deck sat the fair enthusiast, until
cliff and sky became commingled in one dark-blue mass, and soon
completely lost in a&euml;rial distance.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"We viewed the church of <i>Notre Dame</i> at Calais, where there is an
ill-executed, clumsy statue of the Virgin and Child in statuary marble;
the walls are surrounded with paintings of Scriptural subjects, but the
design <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>and the execution are very <i>mediocr&eacute;</i>. As we walked around the
walls of this memorable town, we could not but recollect, with the
deepest interest, that this city had for upwards of two hundred years
appertained to the crown of Britain;&mdash;that here had been manifested the
most generous and devoted love of country;&mdash;that here our own Edward
triumphed over the arms, as the benevolent Emma did over the hearts, of
the patriot citizens of Calais.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Once more I tread the sunny region of merry France, endeared from
youthful recollection; once more too I tread the same soil that holds
him I love the best!&mdash;no, <i>not</i> the <span class="smcap-all">BEST</span>!&mdash;in this earthly globe, and no
longer two seas separate me from him whom I acknowledge by the two most
endearing titles of my husband, and my Adelaide's father. Yes, dearest
friend, this is consoling, and it is balm to the wearied heart of a poor
exile roaming in a far and foreign land!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"But I must continue our route:&mdash;From Calais we proceeded by
Boulogne-Sur-Mer <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>of which I shall just observe, <i>en passant</i>, that it
is a handsome town, it is said of great antiquity, and is very
remarkable from the circumstance of its having been selected as the port
from which the Romans embarked when they invaded Britain; and here still
remain the fragments of a Roman tower built during the reign of
Caligula. From Boulogne we proceeded to Amiens, where we remained for a
couple of days to repose from the fatigues of our journey, and if it
will not <i>fatigue</i> you, you shall have a very brief sketch of that fine
city.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Amiens is a city of great antiquity, it was called <i>Ambianum</i> by the
Romans, and is noticed by C&aelig;sar in his Commentaries.&mdash;Amiens is the
capital of Picardy, and an episcopal See; it is the <i>Samaro-Briva</i> of
the ancients. This city is situated on the navigable river Somme, which
traverses it in three branches, all which unite below the town, beneath
the bridge of St. Michael.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Amiens is a rich and flourishing city, and abounds with numerous
manufactories; it is very pleasantly situated in a fertile and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>well
cultivated country. It is the residence of the governor of Picardy.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Amiens is encompassed by a wall and other fortifications, the ramparts
are planted with trees, which form an agreeable walk; the mall, called
<i>l'Autoy</i>, is also much admired as a delightful promenade. The houses
are well built, the streets are spacious, and the town is embellished
with regular handsome squares and public buildings; namely, the palace
of the Bailiwick, where the governor of Picardy resides, the <i>maison de
ville</i>, or town-hall, the citadel, the square, or <i>place des fleurs</i>,
and the great market square, all which are well deserving the attention
of the traveller. There are ten churches in this city, independent of
the great cathedral of <i>Notre Dame</i>, which is a truly sumptuous and most
magnificent pile, it is built in the florid style of gothic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
architecture, and is accounted one of the finest cathedrals in France.
The nave of the church is greatly and deservedly admired. The building
contains numerous aisles, chapels, and altars, all gorgeously decorated
with shrines, statues, paintings, and monuments. Many of the statues are
of marble, as also the monuments; some others, for instance that of the
Bishop of Amiens, (whose name unluckily I have forgotten,) who founded
the cathedral, are of bronze. There are some oil paintings in the nave,
the subjects taken from Holy Writ, but the execution is very
indifferent.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"As we entered this venerable pile the priests and choir were chanting
the high mass, while the loud, solemn, pealing of the organ's swell
echoed from aisle to altar, wafted the soul beyond the narrow confines
of mortality. The grand altar was brilliantly lighted up, the perfumed
incense arose in clouds to the fretted ceiling, the congregation seemed
sunk in deep and dumb devotion; the service was enchantingly performed,
some <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>exquisite voices assisted; and the scene was truly captivating and
impressive, much to charm the eye and move the heart.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"We have been at this place (Lille)<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> now for four days, but depart on
the morrow for Brussels; and indeed it is with regret that we leave this
delightful city, of which I adventure to give you a brief historical
detail:</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Lisle, or Lille, is a large and strongly fortified city in the
north-east of France, and the capital of French Flanders; it is situated
on the navigable river Deule. The origin of this town is ascribed by
tradition to Julius C&aelig;sar, who is said to have built a castle on an
island in the Deule, whence it derived the name of Insula, Isla, and
eventually of Lisle; the Flemish name is Ryssel; the Latin, <i>Insula
Flandrorum</i>; it is now called Lille.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Lille is situated in a dead flat, the soil whereof is rich and fertile,
and the people industrious. The Deule, although a small river, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>yet is
navigable, and is divided into several branches, parts of which supply
the moats of the citadel, and the fosses of the town; while one branch
of this river, called <i>La Basse Deule</i>, intersects the city. The form of
Lille is that of an irregular oval; it is a large and handsome town, its
appearance is imposing from its extent, its fortifications, its canals,
its bridges, its squares, and public buildings. It is assuredly one of
the handsomest cities of France; much architectural elegance is
displayed not only in private edifices, but particularly in the public
buildings, viz. <i>la bourse</i>, or the exchange, crowned with its cupola
and minaret, the barracks, the corn market, the theatre, five principal
hospitals, besides others. <i>La maison de ville</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> or town-hall,
adjoins the grand place, or square; it formerly had been the palace of
the Dukes of Burgundy; it was built in the year 1430 by Duke Philip the
Good.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Lille had been formerly the residence <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>of the Foresters and Counts of
Flanders; it was founded by Baudouin, surnamed <i>Le Belle Barbe</i>, Count
of Flanders, so early as 1007. His son Baudouin Le Debonaire surrounded
the city with walls, and built the magnificent church of Saint Peter,
where he was interred; and in the middle of the nave of this cathedral
may be seen the tomb of its founder, who was also called by another
designation, <i>Baudouin of Lille</i>. Two Chapters of the order of the
Golden Fleece were held in this collegiate church of Saint Peter, the
first in 1431, the latter in 1436.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"There is in this church a beautiful chapel of our Lady of Treille,
which was built by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, in which is to be
seen a beautiful <i>mausoleum</i> of Bronze, where is represented the Count
Lewis de Male, Count of Flanders, placed between his wife Margaret and
his daughter.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"The other parish churches in this city are, St. Stephen, St. Maurice,
St. Saviour, St. Catherine, St. Andrew, and La Magdelaine. Lille has
seven gates:&mdash;1. Porte de La Barne. 2. De Notre Dame. 3. Des Malades. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
4. De Fives. 5. Saint Maurice. 6. Magdelaine. 7. Saint Andrew.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"This city, as, my dear friend, I have before observed to you, is the
capital of French Flanders, as it was anciently called <i>Flandria
Gallica</i>; and is one of the most populous, rich, and magnificent cities
in the entire circle of French Flanders.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"You will here, no doubt, my dear Madam, pause, and naturally enough
inquire why I should make this long <i>detour</i>, when my ultimate
destination is Brussels;&mdash;what necessity should urge me to visit
Amiens?&mdash;why should I proceed to Lille?&mdash;why not start straight forward
at once for Brussels? I shall explain to you the cause, my dear friend,
as I hate mysteries, and prefer being candid in preference of appearing
absurd or inconsistent. There have been for these many years some near
and dear female connexions of mine, and likewise of the duke, who long
since have forsook the world, and who are abiding in this country, all
of whom have taken the veil; two sisters are stationed at Amiens within
the convent, or <i>Abbaye de St. Sepulchre</i>; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>and two other relatives have
retired here into the convent <i>des S&oelig;urs Noir&egrave;s</i>. These ladies are
now far advanced in years, and fast approaching that goal that one day
we all must ultimately reach. Could I then, my dear Madam, remain in the
same country, inhale the same air, and withal placed within a reasonable
distance, and it resting wholly in my power and inclination whether I
should see them for once, and perhaps for ever! or decline doing so? I
could not&mdash;I would not decline it! No earthly consideration could warp
or cause me to forego this duty! I have seen these venerable saints, for
such I believe them to be, and I am gratified that they are happy; at
least to me they appeared to be so, as they did to my daughter and
sisters. This must be the last time probably that I shall ever see them
imprisoned within those sad monastic walls, the world forgetting, and by
the world forgot! and the leave which I took of them resembled that sad,
solemn, and final farewell, which we receive from the departing voice of
those we regard at the close of their earthly pilgrimage!</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"You shall hear from me again so soon as I am established at Brussels,
where I purpose to remain for a year certainly, and for which city we
start on the morrow. Until then, dearest friend, adieu.</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em">(<i>Signed</i>) <span class="smcap">Katherine Tyrconnel</span>."</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"P. S.&mdash;Please, my dear, most kindly to present all our united
remembrances to your truly worthy lord and prelate. Once more farewell."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The day subsequent to the writing of the foregoing epistle, as has been
determined upon, the duchess and Adelaide, the Ladies Letitia and Lucy,
escorted by Sir Patricius Placebo, departed from Lille on their route to
Brussels. The journey occupied the space of nearly three days; at the
expiration of which the illustrious <i>voyageurs</i> safely arrived at the
noble, the ancient city of Brussels; the drivers were directed to stop
at the hotel <i>Du Flanders</i>, in preference to the hotel <i>d'Angleterr&eacute;</i>,
as it was the wish of the duchess to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>remain retired from any observance
or unnecessary intercourse with her countrymen; and instructed by the
political tone and temper of the times, courted privacy, not publicity;
and this was now the more necessary, as acts of attainder had been
proclaimed by King William against all the adherents and partisans of
King James the Second.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The apartments at the hotel <i>Du Flanders</i> were not only roomy and
commodious, but were likewise fitted up with a considerable degree of
elegance. However, depressed by fatigue of body, as likewise overpowered
by anxiety of mind, the duchess and her fair and lovely daughter retired
at an early hour to repose, which example was as immediately followed by
the retiring of Ladies Letitia and Lucy, and Sir Patricius Placebo, to
their respective dormitories.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>The duchess and Lady Adelaide had two beds stationed in the same
chamber, which always, during the absence of the duke, was invariably
the custom; and in the adjoining bed-chamber reposed the Ladies Letitia
and Lucy.</p>

<p>Sir Patricius was not neglectful of his personal comforts upon any
occasion, at least that has been recorded, and happy to find himself
once more stationary for a determinate time at Brussels, he emphatically
ejaculated his favourite sentence&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">DOSS MOI, TANE STIGMEN!</p>

<p>and soon was enfolded in the silken fetters of Morpheus.</p>

<p>The duchess usually sat up an hour or two in her chamber previous to her
retiring to repose, her time being occupied in reading, writing, or
entering memoranda in her common-place book; but her Grace always
finished with her devotions. When these were duly performed, slowly
advancing to the bedside of her beloved daughter, she already be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>held
her in a profound sleep. "Happy state of youth!" thought the duchess,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">"Thou hast no figures, nor no fantasies,<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Which busy care draws in the brains of men:<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Therefore thou sleep'st so sound."<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, my darling daughter, may care, anxiety, and sorrow, ever be
strangers to thy dwelling! and, oh heaven grant, that thy bosom, and thy
peace of mind, may be ever calm and serene as at this present moment
they are!"</p>

<p>Having mentally expressed this fervent prayer, the duchess retired to
her pillow, mournfully revolving upon the past, and deeply meditating
upon the future; much wearied both from mental, as well as bodily
fatigue, she fell into a deep slumber. But her sleep was restless and
perturbed, she went back to the days of her youth. For as Milton finely
expresses,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>The duchess again beheld her early friends, once more she partook of
their juvenile pastimes. Time advances&mdash;her courtship with the duke
proceeds&mdash;her consent to the marriage given&mdash;the wedding takes
place&mdash;the birth of Adelaide&mdash;the duke's increased favour with his
sovereign&mdash;his several appointments&mdash;his promotion&mdash;the introduction of
the duchess at court&mdash;the duke presented with the order of the garter,
and appointed viceroy of Ireland&mdash;the scenes attendant thereon&mdash;Adelaide
the admiration of every eye, and the praise of every tongue. All these
events, conjured up by deceptive vision, passed in rapid succession,
seen through the <i>camera obscura</i> of the past. Now floats before her
tortured fancy the obverse of the medal:&mdash;The battle of the Boyne is
fought and lost&mdash;King James is forced to make a precipitate flight&mdash;the
Duke of Tyrconnel accompanies his deposed sovereign&mdash;the duke is
outlawed by King William, who passes an act of attainder against
him&mdash;the duchess is compelled to depart from Ireland&mdash;Adelaide
accompanies her mother in her voyage. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>The dream continues:&mdash;The duchess
much perturbed&mdash;at sea they encounter a violent storm&mdash;she and Adelaide
are about to perish in a watery grave. The duchess moans, and becomes
deeply depressed, which awakened Adelaide, who arose, and gently opening
the shutter, the rays of a summer sun glanced in at the casement. Then
putting on her attire with great caution and silence Adelaide seated
herself by her mother's side. The duchess greatly disturbed in her
sleep, with a deep moan and restless motion turned around in the bed; in
doing so her arm fell next Adelaide; who gently, but affectionately,
kissed her mother's hand, and while in the act the duchess awoke.</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>this</i>, at least, is no vision to mock my misery!&mdash;I am
awake&mdash;<i>this</i> is no dream! Oh, my dear, dear Adelaide!&mdash;my darling child
is it you?"</p>

<p>The duchess sat up in her bed, and warmly embracing Adelaide, while the
fond, maternal tear moistened as it fell upon her daughter's cheek, she
said:&mdash;"May heaven ever bless and protect thee, my dear and duteous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>daughter, and its gracious mercy be always thine! for thou hast ever
been dutiful to thy parents, and obedient to thy Creator!"</p>

<p>The duchess now arose, and as neither her Grace nor Adelaide expended
any unnecessary waste of time at their toilette, they were soon at their
post at the breakfast table. Sir Patricius rung, and desired the waiter
to place a Malines ham and a bottle of Louvain beer on the side-table,
both of which he declared were excellent in their kind; some of the
ladies tasted the ham, but the Louvain beer remained untasted except by
the provident Baronet himself, who smacked his lips, and observed that
it was passing good; and then noticed that there were three kinds of it,
that which lay upon the table was of the weakest sort; the next was
called Caniac, which was to be met with at the tables of the noblesse
and the wealthier bourgeois; the strongest kind is called Peterman,
which, he observed, was sold at the coffee-houses in the evening; and in
such repute is Louvain beer held, he said, that annually one hundred and
fifty thousand tuns are brewed for exportation; "but for my poor part," <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
next continued Sir Patricius, (filling out a second glass,) "I have
slight objection to quaff it at the fountain head!&mdash;"<i>Satius est petere
fontes, quam sectari rivulos.</i>"&mdash;Ha, ha, ha!</p>

<p>Breakfast having terminated, and the practical panegyric of Sir
Patricius on Louvain beer and Malines ham being duly exemplified and
concluded, the duchess sallied forth in search of a furnished house,
which her Grace intended to engage for a term not less than that of a
year. Three or four houses were inspected, but they were found not to
answer; one was too small to accommodate the family, another was
indifferently furnished, a third was objected to from its unpleasantness
of situation; a fourth was examined, which was agreeably situated in the
Rue Ducale, opposite to the park; this seemed to promise well, Sir
Patricius rang the hall bell, and a tall, meagre figure, in a rich
flowered silk robe <i>de chambre</i>, and his head enveloped in a red
night-cap, opened the door; it was Monsieur Passemier, the proprietor of
the house, who grinned and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>bowed most obsequiously; he was about
sixty-five years of age, but seemed in spirits, and also in activity, to
enjoy all the vigour of youth. He now proceeded to show the house: the
hall, or vestibule, was spacious, and very handsomely ornamented with
marble tables, bronze busts on brackets, and a statue of white marble of
the god of silence. The garden, which adjoined the hall, was very
tastefully laid out; a corridore of trellis work, entwined with parasite
plants, led from the hall to the garden, where several walks, arched
above, formed pleasant arbours, through and around which the clustering
vines had entwined themselves, and now displayed their luxuriant bunches
of red and white grapes.</p>

<p>The duchess ascended to the drawing-rooms, which were hung with rich
Brussels' tapestry, and hangings of Arras; the subjects represented were
woven from designs of Teni&euml;rs, Snyders, and Rubens; the different
compartments represented village fairs, rural merry-makings, and boar
hunts.</p>

<p>The sofas, or settees rather we should <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>say, the rude, gothic
predecessors of the present modern sofa, were extremely long and
extremely low, and yet withal of an enormous size; they were covered
with blue velvet, and fringed with gold lace; the chairs, which
corresponded, were on castors, and were of that formidable space and
magnitude to have afforded seats to the two redoubtable city giants of
Guild-Hall, Messieurs Gog and Magog, who, if hither transported, might
have held thereon a seeming <i>t&ecirc;te-&aacute;-t&ecirc;te</i>, without any diminution or
disparagement of their gravity and greatness.</p>

<p>Monsieur Passemier, (for to the lank gentleman in the red night-cap the
said mansion appertained,) ever and anon was restlessly employed in
raising or lowering the red cap on his forehead, and with continued and
extravagant grin, grimace, and gesticulation, became exceedingly
loquacious, his teeth chattering most monkey-like. He dwelt much on the
commodiousness of his house, the fine view of the park which it
commanded, the fashionableness of the situation, the salubrity of the
air, the convenience of his <i>jardin orn&egrave;</i>; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>and rung various
changes on the fine furniture of his mansion, so superior, he insisted,
to <i>les miserabl&egrave;s meubles garnis</i> of Paris; he once indeed
(<i>malheureux!</i>) had, in an evil hour, let lodgings, but he would never
do so again&mdash;<i>jamais!</i> He once, <i>pardi&eacute;</i>, had set these apartments
(<i>en haut</i>) to Monsieur Le Compte d'Egmont and Madame la Comptesse, <i>et
quatres petites diables des enfants</i>; the lower (<i>en bas</i>) apartments
were set to le bon Ev&ecirc;que de Brug&egrave;s. But, <i>une jour</i>, Le Compte et Madam
la Comptesse were abroad <i>pour faire visite</i>, when <i>les quatres petites
diables des enfants</i> made, <i>mon Dieu!</i> such a <i>grand bouleversement</i>,
you never did hear&mdash;no persone did ever see de like.</p>

<p>Here Monsieur Passemier acted to the life <i>encore le tres grande
bouleversement</i>, flinging down, with great force, fire, fury, and
energy, stool, tripod, candelabra, chairs, &amp;c., and scattering around
the broken fragments of marble tables. He then, with the agility of a
Shamois goat, bounded from stool to chair and settee, indeed he seemed
as if recently escaped from Bedlam; he jumped, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>stamped, he danced,
he laughed, he chattered, racing round the room, jumping on chairs and
settees, and violently stamping and kicking thereon, and by practical
illustrations demonstrating how <i>les quatres petites diables des enfants
d'Egmont</i> had accomplished <i>cet horrible bouleversement</i>! and all dat in
defiance of <i>le petite dieu de silence, dans le grande vestibule</i>, who,
<i>avec le main droite</i>, to his lip does (<i>tout le gentilhomme</i>) impose
silence, and <i>avec le main gauche</i>, does vid <i>beaucoup de politesse</i>
point de way <i>en haut! pour vous montez. Le bon Ev&ecirc;que de Brug&egrave;s</i> left
me <i>au d&egrave;sespoir! pauvre homme, car, malheureux</i>,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Il ne pouvoit pas</i>,<br /></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>ni lir&eacute;</i>,<br /></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>ni dir&eacute;</i>,<br /></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>ni rir&eacute;</i>,<br /></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>ni pri&eacute;r</i>,<br /></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><i>ni ecrir&eacute;</i>,<br /></span></p>

<p><i>et mon Dieu! quelle horrible, il ne pouvoit pas dormire!</i></p>

<p>The duchess came in for more of the <i>bouleversement</i> than her Grace had
calculated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>upon; and having concluded her bargain, hastened to depart
before the lank landlord in the red night-cap could, by possibility, be
seized with another fit of <i>la malad&eacute; du bouleversement</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Patricius was extremely diverted with the eccentricities of this
original, and declared that the Monsieur was wondrous comical&mdash;most
amusingly facetious.</p>

<p>The duchess and Lady Adelaide, &amp;c. drove through the squares and
principal streets of Brussels, they visited the park l'Alle Verte,
&amp;c.; and then drove to Soignies Forest: Adelaide was highly
delighted, and with much liveliness and enthusiasm, she
said:&mdash;"Fair Brussels! renowned in days of ancient chivalry, aye,
full many a joust, tilt, and tournament, hast thou witnessed within
thine princely walls, when kings and mighty paladines sought valour's
prize and beauty's smile, while trumpets brayed the victor's fame, and
damsels gave the guerdon to the brave! Nor, Soignies, ever be thy dark
forest forgot, here many a chase has re-echoed throughout thy woodland
waste, led <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>on by prince and peer, what time the savage boar of
the forest, roused from his lair, started forth on the hunter's path,
and sunk beneath his valiant spear, while blithely the bugle reckless
rung his requiem!"</p>

<p>"My dear daughter, you are the child of romance, and you should have
been born in the days of chivalry, for our own days are too tame and
common-place for thee withal!"</p>

<p>"I do commend, my lady duchess," said Sir Patricius, "the enthusiasm of
the Lady Adelaide; and I must take occasion to observe, that although
there is much liveliness, there is likewise much historical truth in the
young lady's remarks. <i>Certes</i> Brussels is a fine city; in many respects
it may vie with Paris. Look at the park, at the promenades, the palaces,
the mansions, churches, fountains, &amp;c.; and I will be bold to say that
in healthfulness of its climate, the beauty of its local situation, the
spaciousness of its streets, the abundance and cheapness of its
provisions, that at this period Brussels is probably second to no city
in Europe. It is proverbial for the luxuriance of its fruits and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
vegetables.&mdash;And now, my Lady Duchess, I do remember me that Anne of
Cleves, the consort of King Henry VIII. of England, whom he somewhat
ungallantly called a Flanders mare"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was indeed," observed the duchess, "not only an uncourtly, but it
was an unkinglike phrase!"</p>

<p>"I was about to observe, my Lady Duchess, that Anne of Cleves used
frequently to send to the <i>Pays Bas</i> for a sallad! and I dare be sworn,
my lady, that if her Majesty had only known what a luxurious fruit
Flemish cherries and strawberries were, which latter they call here
<i>frais&egrave;s <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has Angloises">l'Anglaises</span></i>, and in size are as large as the largest walnut,
and their exquisite flavour quite unparalleled&mdash;no doubt, I think, but
that the queen would have despatched a special messenger to procure a
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has desert">dessert</span> of those delicious fruits of Flanders, provided they would have
borne the carriage. Ay, though even her royal head were to pay the
forfeit I' faith!&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"To lose one's head were rather an unseemly joke for a bunch of Flemish <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
fruit; besides, methinks it were rather too dear a purchase even in the
decapitating days of bluff Harry Tudor!" observed Lady Adelaide.</p>

<p>"Commend me the spirit," said her Grace, "of the Duchess of Milan, who,
when Henry had sent an ambassador demanding her hand in marriage, she
boldly desired the ambassador to tell his master that she must decline
the honour which his Majesty had so graciously intended, as she had but
one head: if she had had two indeed, one of them should certainly be at
the disposal of his Majesty of England!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha,&mdash;'fore Jupiter," exclaimed Sir Patricius, "her Highness was
as witty as she was spirited!&mdash;Ha, ha, ha."</p>

<p>The duchess now deemed it full time for her Grace to send a despatch to
the palace of d'Aremberg, addressed to her old friend,&mdash;her once
youthful, lovely friend&mdash;the kind associate of her early years, the
Duchess d'Aremberg, notifying her arrival at Brussels, and likewise,
meanwhile, expressing the cogent reasons which had rendered such a step
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>necessary, if not imperative; at the same time also intimating her
intention of calling upon the following day at an early hour specified,
to pay her demonstrations of love, regard, and respect.</p>

<p>Accordingly, upon the following day, and at the appointed time, the
duchess, accompanied solely by Lady Adelaide, waited upon her Grace
d'Aremberg at the ducal palace.</p>

<p>Our readers no doubt possibly may recollect the relationship in which
the Duchess d'Aremberg stood to the Lady Adelaide, that her Grace was
Lady Adelaide's <i>marrain&eacute;</i>, or godmother. They too may perchance
recollect the princely baptismal presents given on the august occasion,
and long since narrated in our story, all of which have been duly
detailed in the second chapter of the first volume of this romance.</p>

<p>The meeting was of the tenderest and most affecting description. The
Duchess d'Aremberg had been for some years a widow, but she was not
childless, she had an only son, the present Duke d'Aremberg. Her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>sight
was much impaired, being obliged to wear spectacles; but notwithstanding
this, her countenance still bore striking traits that she had once been
beautiful. Her constitution had been so much impaired by ill-health,
caused by paralysis, and not by years, that her Grace had nearly lost
the powers of locomotion: she moved on crutches. But still her brilliant
eye beamed forth intelligence; and still warm and true to all its fires,
her generous and expanded heart was alive to every social tie, to every
noble impulse, and every endearing feeling. While, meantime, every
object around bore strong indications of mortality; in one station was
placed her once favourite paroquet, that had gaily talked in its cage,
and had each successive morning duly greeted its mistress's
approach.&mdash;There now it stood a stiff and motionless mummy, a mere
mockery of what it once had been! The cherished and favourite lapdog too
had undergone a similar transformation, and starchly stuffed, and
studded with its glaring eye-balls, unspeculatingly stared from its
glassy cabinet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duchess of Tyrconnel warmly embraced with tender and intense
affection her old, her once young, her still kind-hearted friend, while
their tears, united, trickled down in comminglement on the cheeks of
each beloved friend; while Adelaide, whose heart was ever responsive to
every impulse of affection or affliction, wept a flood of tears. This
transport of joy and tears having passed the Duchess d'Aremberg strongly
pressed, with the kindest and most affectionate solicitation, that her
early friend and her goddaughter should, during their sojourn at
Brussels, make the palace d'Aremberg their home, where they would be as
free from restraint as if the residence were their own. But the Duchess
of Tyrconnel declined in terms of the deepest gratitude, at the same
time in the tone of firm determination. Her Grace said that they should
be often together, and that every day, if possible, during her stay,
accompanied by Adelaide, they would have the pleasure of passing a large
portion of their time with the Duchess d'Aremberg.</p>

<p>Upon being made acquainted that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>duchess had taken a house in the
<i>Rue Ducale</i>, and that the Ladies Letitia and Lucy, and Sir Patricius
Placebo, had accompanied her in her journey, matters were so far
compromised by an invitation being made and accepted of, that on that
same day the entire party should dine within the hospitable walls of the
palace d'Aremberg.</p>

<p>While the two old friends were in deep converse the young Duke
d'Aremberg entered the apartment, and was formally introduced by his
amiable mother to the Duchess of Tyrconnel and to Lady Adelaide.</p>

<p>The Duke d'Aremberg was a few years elder than our heroine. He was
remarkably handsome, tall in person, and martial in appearance, well
made, and much admired for the symmetry of his form. His deportment was
dignified and graceful, as free from <i>hauteur</i> as it was devoid of
conceit and affectation. His eye-brows were dark, his eyes hazel, which
sparkled with intelligence. His complexion was, however, rather
saturnine; and in person as well as in visage, he much resembled the
portrait of his illustrious grandfather, which hung in the d'Aremberg <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
palace, as drawn by the inimitable hand of Vandyke, of which a fine
engraving by Earlom has been handed down to posterity. The same
characteristic melancholy too which had predominated in the expression
of countenance in his grandsire prevailed likewise in the lineaments of
the grandson; but withal mildness and intelligence of expression gave an
intense tone of interest to the manly and open expression of his visage,
which was in sooth the index of his truly noble heart. He was generous,
he was brave, and accomplished as he was learned: hence it is
unnecessary to say that he was most agreeable and affable in his
manners. He was truly beloved by all his dependants, as he was courted
by his associates, and respected and adored by his friends.</p>

<p>The duchess and Lady Adelaide remained about two hours at the palace
d'Aremberg, and then returned to their house in the <i>Rue Ducale</i> to
attire for dinner. At a few moments before three o'clock punctually they
returned to the palace. Two, or even so early <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>as one o'clock, was then
the usual hour of dinner upon the continent; but in compliment to her
friends it was postponed until the third hour. The Earl of Aylesbury and
his countess, who was his second wife, and his son, Lord Eyrecourt, were
the only guests invited, and they had first arrived.</p>

<p>We must here trespass a few words on our reader, briefly to say what he
may perchance not be already acquainted with. The noble peer here
noticed was Thomas, the second Earl of Aylesbury. He had rallied around
King James upon the event of the Prince of Orange having embarked troops
for England. But when King James withdrew himself from Whitehall, in
order to embark for France, Lord Aylesbury was one of the twenty-five
peers who signed the declaration applying to the Prince of Orange to
rescue the country from "popery and slavery." He subsequently, however,
took a different part, having been implicated or accused in an attempt
to restore the abdicated monarch to his throne and realm, in consequence
of which accusation his Lordship was committed a prisoner to the tower <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of London by order of Queen Mary, the consort of William III., at the
time that William was in Ireland. The charge or accusation was for
having consulted and conspired how to restore King James. His countess,
the Lady Elizabeth, was so afflicted at her lord's confinement, that she
died in childbirth, when the month following her husband, the Earl, was
admitted to bail.</p>

<p>His Lordship afterwards obtained leave of King William to reside at
Brussels; and a year or two previous to this period he secondly married
Charlotte, Countess of Sann&uuml;, of the ancient and noble house of
Argenteau, in the Duchy of Brabant, by whom he had a daughter, Charlotte
Maria,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> an infant at this time of about twelve months old.</p>

<p>The Earl of Aylesbury<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> was a nobleman <i>de La Vieille cour</i> of the most <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
polished manners. Every thing he said or did was done with a peculiar
grace and ease. He had read much, and remembered with judicious
advantage what he had read. He abounded in amusing anecdotes, had seen
much of the world, and had read men as well as books.</p>

<p>However, it cannot be denied that he was at times stately in his
deportment; and he never appeared at his own dinner-table, even when
none were present but his own family, unless in a full court-dress <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
costume, with the appendices of star and ribbon, which made many to
suspect that a deep affection for aristocracy was rooted in his breast.</p>

<p>The countess was low in stature as she was in mind. Her figure, however,
though small, was passing well; her complexion sallow; her eyes dark and
lively. She possessed more envy than good-nature, more passion than
sense, and more pertness than pride. Her chief, and probably only
recommendations, were the ancient nobility of her family and the
largeness of her fortune, two qualifications that rarely, if ever,
bestow happiness upon the marriage state.</p>

<p>Lord Eyrecourt was the only surviving offspring of the deceased
countess, and heir apparent to the earldom of Aylesbury. He was
confessedly a finished <i>petite maitr&egrave;</i>&mdash;the daily slave of his barber,
perfumer, tailor, and looking-glass. To Monsieur Jasmin, his perfumer,
in the <i>Rue Madelaine</i>, he had lately paid the enormous sum of six
hundred ducats, being his bill for the last year for lotions, perfumes,
cosmetics, &amp;c.</p>

<p>His Lordship never appeared abroad <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>until close upon the hour of dinner,
"for," he averred, "it would be vastly supersingular, and besides
extremely vulgar in him, to be seen abroad before the sun had fully
mounted the meridian, and the world had become well warmed!"</p>

<p>Lord Eyrecourt was, in verity, a strange and singular model of a man,
and, to use his own favourite expression&mdash;"Odds my life, my person and
accomplishments are supersingular, and not to be matched!" His Lordship
was in height about five feet five, with brawny shoulders and arms, a
bronzed visage, that seemed resolved to outstare the world in
confidence; his cheeks were meantime of that roseate hue that the
scandalous chronicle of the times reported that they fully owed their
blooming radiance to the cosmetics of Monsieur Jasmin. His neck was
short, and bull-modelled; and this self-supposed Adonis finished his
form by thighs and legs of elephantine shape and form. In London he had
obtained the <i>soubriqu&eacute;t</i>, or nick-name, of "The Pocket Hercules," which
title followed him to Brussels. "<i>Voil&aacute;, mi</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span><i>Lor Hercul&eacute;, de la
poche!&mdash;bah! ha, ha!</i>" has been often repeated within his Lordship's
hearing.</p>

<p>When this <i>great</i> man in his own eyes, did condescend to speak, he
lisped most miraculously; and his whole mien and manner were in complete
variance with nature and simplicity.</p>

<p>It was marvellous strange, but true, that this misshapen model of
mortality in his own eyes really fancied himself the handsomest man of
the day, whether in England, France, or Belgium, the true and most
redoubtable Antinous of the age! and he fondly fancied that every dame
who set eye upon his irresistible charms, immediately became
irretrievably enamoured! so prepossessing and fascinating did he behold
himself reflected in the mirror of egotism and vanity. His lordship was
peculiarly fond of repeating this, his much favourite passage, from
Massinger:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The dinner at the palace d'Aremberg was magnificent, and passed off with
a good deal of good-humour, and some laughter at the expense of Lord
Eyrecourt. The Lady Adelaide this day made a double conquest,&mdash;of the
Duke d'Aremberg, who became deeply captivated with her beauty and
accomplishments; and of Lord Eyrecourt, who declared that it was vastly
supersingular that at last the barb of Cupid rankled in his bosom, and
that he was in a fair way of being caught in the toils of matrimony!</p>

<p>The ensuing morning, at an early hour, Lord Eyrecourt presented himself
in the <i>Rue Ducale</i>, where the love-struck Lord loud and lustily rang at
the door of the palace of Tyrconnel. The duchess happened at the time to
be looking out from the front window, and observed to Lady Adelaide,
"See, my love, who now approaches this mansion; I foresaw, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>my dear
daughter, all this, and that during his presence the last evening, that
you had made a deep and firm impression, aye, and conquest to boot, of
this self-sick Adonis. So I pray that you see him, and hearken to his
most precious proposals, for such you will find to be the object of this
his matutinal visit; which said intended proposals I know to a certainty
thou wilt reject. Hence I entertain no apprehensions whatever, sweet
daughter of mine, in this perilous <i>rencontre</i>," said the duchess,
smiling; "for I well know that all his matrimonial propositions thou
wilt firmly reject. I shall just in due and stately form receive him,
and then retire to my cabinet, whence I can with facility overhear all
the ridiculous rhapsodical speeches of this painted popinjay. Do you,
notwithstanding, my dear daughter, hear him with a sufficient sum of due
patience, meet respect, and with all becoming attention and gratitude;
for any man offering his hand to a fair lady is entitled, by all the
rules and achievements of the courts of chivalry, love, and courtesy, to
a meet and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>becoming audience. But be brief as thou canst; and the
sooner that with due distant and becoming politeness, he were despatched
it were all so much the better, and then we shall fully have an end to
all his <i>faribol&eacute;s mal appliqu&eacute;s</i>."</p>

<p>"Fear not," said the Lady Adelaide, "my dearest mother, my fullest
obedience."</p>

<p>Here another loud and lusty pull at the hall-bell announced an arrival,
when almost immediately Lord Eyrecourt was announced, and ushered in by
the footman in waiting. His Lordship, with much grimace, and a smirking
visage withal, made two low bows on his <i>entr&egrave;</i>, and advanced with a
gait which was a halting attempt between a <i>chass&eacute;</i> and a <i>pirou&euml;tte</i>.
But although this was all self sufficiently done, it was truly and
practically the tramp and gait of an elephant, if indeed we could for a
moment suppose that mighty creature could stalk on his hind legs; but in
other respects "the half-reasoning" quadruped of Africa was every way
the superior of the animal who now made his approach.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-morrow to your Grace," lisped forth this conceited popinjay.
"Good-morrow too, sweet and most lovely Lady Adelaide; permit, fairest
lady, your lowly servant a <i>b&egrave;so las m&agrave;nos</i>!"</p>

<p>Here the duchess thought it decorous to withdraw, and her Grace retired
to her cabinet.</p>

<p>"Hail, fairest gem of Erin, bright star of Belgium, and the brilliant
sun of Brussels! at sight of thee every eye is enamoured, and every
heart takes fire; in witness whereof behold me your lowly servant abroad
at this most unfashionable hour, thus prevailing upon myself to come
forth and throw my person and my fortunes at your feet, even before that
Ph&oelig;bus hath mounted his meridian car, and the world has become well
warmed, to place myself and coronet thus lowly at your feet!"</p>

<p>"Oh rise, my Lord, from that&mdash;&mdash;what, kneel to a mere mortal! I pray you
be seated, and I shall endeavour to reply to all the compliments with
which your Lordship is so prodigally pleased to overpower me. I must, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>Lord, acknowledge, that your Lordship indulges somewhat too freely in
mixed metaphor; and I must needs add, you deal somewhat too
superabundantly in rhapsodies.&mdash;Well, my Lord, let us see what I am like
unto? 'A gem of Erin!' pray what is that? Oh, no doubt whatever but it
must mean a simple piece of Kerry crystal!&mdash;oh, vastly pretty indeed;
and almost as nearly transparent as your Lordship's flattery. Well,
good, my Lord! what comparison comes next?&mdash;Oh, I am 'a Star!' in this I
cannot confess that your Lordship's wit shines superlatively.&mdash;Pshaw, my
Lord, a star is merely a minor light, and visible only at night! Nay
now, after all, this simile is only but just so, so. However, I am amply
repaid by that which so brilliantly succeeds, 'the Sun of Brussels!'
Well, come, that I must needs admit is a resplendent metaphor; but the
sun of Brussels I must fain likewise confess I have found too often to
my cost, to be a very warm and burning sun. What comes next?&mdash;Oh, quite
portentous!&mdash;I blaze, burn, and destroy, setting eyes in a flame, and
hearts on fire, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>so forth, in a most formidable comet-like fashion!
What this can actually mean, unless it prove a sort of periphrasis, and
be slyly intended for a Salamander, I cannot indeed divine. Then if my
conjectures prove correct, only think, O glorious Apollo, after the
complete extinction of all the tropes, figures, flowers, and poesies,
culled from amid the verdant valleys of thine own lofty Parnassus, for
thy votary-like Icarus to tumble from the Olympian sky, and to suffer
his divine goddess, the object of his idolatrous veneration, to
degenerate into a fire-loving earthly Salamander! Oh, by prose and
verse, but this is vastly funny!"</p>

<p>"Ah, cruel, cruel, remorseless Lady Adelaide, is it thus you sportively
jest at my pains, and mock my misery!&mdash;I die for you!"</p>

<p>"Really, my Lord, this is all so very sudden&mdash;the symptoms too so very
alarming, I <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has fell">feel</span> quite agitated&mdash;dejected! Pray, let me advise you, my
Lord, to call in the advice of Sir Patricius Placebo, whose skill is
undisputed!"</p>

<p>"No, fair torturer! you, Lady, and you alone, who caused the malady, can
cure it!" <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"My Lord, seek out one more deserving of the honour which you so nobly
proffer me, but I never can be yours; nor shall I ever give my hand
unless I also can give my heart. And now, my Lord, farewell, accept my
humble gratitude and sincerest thanks for the high distinction which you
have so graciously paid me, and which I shall ever remember with the
utmost respect and gratitude."</p>

<p>Having so said, Lady Adelaide deeply courtesied, and withdrew.</p>

<p>"Odds my life now," exclaimed the disappointed peer, "but this is most
passing strange, supersingular, and not to be matched! What, refuse the
heir apparent of an earldom, (and with modesty let me express it,) with
my person and qualifications! Insufferable! It is not to be endured!"</p>

<p>As Lord Eyrecourt, much discomfitted, departed from the <i>Rue Ducale</i>, he
met the Duke d'Aremberg going in that direction; they saluted as they
passed, while he continued his sorrowful soliloquy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Lady Adelaide is downright mad <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>to refuse me; but it seems she
soars at higher game, and looks to 'the pride of place.' She said she
would never give her hand without bestowing her heart, doubtless then
this honour she has already conferred upon the youthful d'Aremberg.&mdash;It
is but too fatally evident! Oh, woe is me to come out in the cold air of
the morn, before the world had become well warmed; and finally thus to
be so totally eclipsed! Oh, some ominous morning I shall be found
hanging from the top of Saint Michael's Tower, or my unfortunate corpse
be seen floating in the Antwerp canal!</p>

<p class="center">LETTER II.</p>

<blockquote><p>THE DUCHESS OF TYRCONNEL TO MRS. CARTWRIGHT.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:20em"><i>Dated</i>, Brussels, <i>September</i>, 169&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p>"Oh, give me joy! for yesterday my beloved husband, to our unexpected
happiness, returned to my arms! Oh, how it delights me he has returned;
and has received permission from the higher powers to remain at
Brussels. My Adelaide is wild with joy, and so am I.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, the duke has returned, and I behold every object with redoubled
interest&mdash;with renewed delight; all seems to me to be newly created. The
climate is more charming, the air is more sweetly perfumed with aromatic
gales, the melody of the birds is more harmonious; every sky which I see
is a Breughel sky. And <i>now</i> I behold daily illustrations of the old
masters, which I did not observe before, in the scenery which surrounds
me, the various buildings, manners, customs, and costume, and all so
faithfully portrayed to the life, in the performances of Berghem,
Breughel, Rubens, and Teniers.</p>

<p>"Sweeter too, to me, at eve, is the song of the nightingale: our house
fronts the park, which is the favourite retreat of this sweetest of
warblers; and night after night, long after Saint Gudule hath tolled the
midnight hour, have I sat stationed at my latticed casement, the breeze
of heaven blowing on my brow, and the cold moon-beam gleaming on my
cheek, while I listened with mute delight to the melancholy songster of
the night. And often while the bitter tear fast trickled down <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>my cheek,
methought&mdash;I acknowledge my weakness&mdash;methought that I had listened to
some poor widowed bird who mourned her absent mate, singing, as the old
proverb runs, with a thorn wounding her breast! But oh, <i>now</i> I think
quite differently; for <i>now</i> it is quite clear to me that the warbling
of the nightingale is more musical than melancholy; for surely, after
all, it sweetly trills the notes of love, and not the strains of sorrow!</p>

<p>"You are pleased, my dear Mrs. Cartwright, to express so much
satisfaction, in verity, more than its deserts, of my poor account of
Lille; and at the same time expressing your desire that I should write
to you from this truly delightful city, and give you a true and distinct
account of Brussels, that I am flattered, and even tempted to take you
at your word, and I shall do my best, to the fullest to gratify your
wishes.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear friend, <i>pour commenc&egrave;r avec le commencement</i>, as they
say in France, and why not in Belgium? The appellation of <span class="smcap">Pays-Bas</span>, or
the Low Country, is given to the seventeen provinces of Belgium, from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the circumstance that in many places the ground is lower than the level
of the sea. The sovereign princes of this realm were at first styled
Foresters of Flanders, afterwards they were designated Counts, and then
Dukes of Brabant. If you should wish to learn the portrait of a Forester
of Flanders, here it is:&mdash;Behold him arrayed in ducal bonnet and hunting
gear, armed with sabre, dirk, and hunting spear, at the same time
accompanied and surrounded by all the <i>accessoires</i> of the chase; his
hawk, or falcon, resting upon his hand, and his greyhounds and spaniels
following at his heels; meanwhile attended by his jager and his
jongeling.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Thus accompanied and equipped for the chase, sallied forth
the manly Prince Forester of Flanders in the olden time.</p>

<p>"The etymon of Brussels is uncertain; however it is not for me to hazard
an opinion upon the subject, which I freely leave to the more solemn
adjudication of learned linguists, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>pertinent philologists, and sapient
scholiasts. I shall merely observe, that some pretend that it is derived
from a neighbouring marsh, which is called Brocksel; while others more
strenuously contend that the name springs from the word <i>Broussailes</i>,
(Brambles,) because the town, say they, had been built upon a spot which
had formerly been covered with brambles. The foundation of Brussels is
counted from the year, <i>anno salutis</i>, 900. But it did not rank as a
city until 1040.</p>

<p>"The city of Brussels, says Guicciardini, the celebrated historian of
Italy and of Belgium, (or the <i>Pays-Bas</i>,) resembles in its
conformation, or outline, the form of the human heart, and the
similitude certainly is striking and correct.</p>

<p>"Puteanus, the historian, observes, that every thing is <i>septenary</i> at
Brussels; which made many to consider the number <i>seven</i> as completely
of cabalistic import in this fair and renowned city.</p>

<p>"The circumference of Brussels is <i>seven</i> miles in extent. Anciently
<i>seven</i> different noble families held their several castles within
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>the city, from whom sprung the <i>seven</i> Patrician families, from
whose numbers the magistrates were annually chosen.</p>

<p>"This city, under the reign of Charles V., boasted at one time of having
<i>seven</i> sovereigns residing within its walls; namely, the Emperor
Charles V.; his son Philip, then king of Naples; Maximilian, king of
Bohemia, and his consort, the queen of Hungary, who was regent of the
<i>Pays-Bas</i>; the king of Tunis, in Africa, named Muley Hassan; the Duke
of Savoy; the king of Cyprus; and the Duchess of Lorraine, who was queen
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"There are <i>seven</i> large squares:&mdash;1. The great market. 2. Le grand&egrave;
sablon. 3. The fish market. 4. The corn market. 5. The wood market. 6.
Le Place Louvaine. 7. The beef market.</p>

<p>"There are <i>seven</i> fountains which ornament this city.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>"The gates of the city are <i>seven</i> in number:&mdash;1. The porte of Louvaine.
2. Of Namur. 3. Of Halle. 4. Of Anderlecht. 5. Of Flanders. 6. Of
Lacken. 7. Of Cologne.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"The principal churches of the city are likewise <i>seven</i> in number:&mdash;1.
Saint Gudule. 2. Our Lady of the Chapel. 3. Saint Gery. 4. Saint
Nicholas. 5. Saint Catherine. 6. Saint James of Caudenberg, (this is the
chapel of the court.) 7. Our Lady <i>de finis Terr&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>"Brussels, so justly celebrated, is a large, populous, and magnificent
city, of considerable extent and beauty; adorned with magnificent
squares, sumptuous palaces, public buildings, public walks, public
fountains, and venerable gothic structures. It is partly built on the
winding banks of the river Senne, and partly upon a hill, which commands
an extended view of the rich valleys which surround it, producing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
fruits and vegetables of the best and most luxuriant kind; indeed
tillage in no country whatever is better understood and practised than
it is in the <i>Pays Bas</i>. This city had been the capital of the Spanish,
it has now, since change of masters, become the capital of the Austrian
Netherlands.</p>

<p>"Brussels once afforded an asylum to Charles II. of England, brother to
our gentle, but unfortunate, James II. It was here that the emperor
Charles V. resigned his dominions to his son Philip in 1535; and the
chair upon which he sat during the performance of the abdication, is
religiously preserved in the cathedral of Sainte Gudule. And here too
Christiana, Queen of Sweden, voluntarily abdicated her crown in 1654.</p>

<p>"The lower part of the city is crowned with that noble pile of florid
gothic architecture, called <i>La Maison de Ville</i>, or town-hall of
Brussels, which is situated in the grand market-place; its noble
steeple, from its great elevation, is a most conspicuous object in,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>every direction, and is seen at a great distance; it rises to the
height of three hundred and sixty-four feet, and is surmounted by a
colossal bronze statue, (which is gilt,) and seventeen feet high, of
Saint Michael the Archangel, to which I fear I must somewhat profanely
add the <i>soubriqu&eacute;t</i> of 'weathercock,' or vane; for to such vile use
have they turned the saint, and this too, credit me, in a Catholic
country! This is wondrous strange. Saint Michael is represented
brandishing his sword to the winds of heaven; and from this dizzy and
elevated height the reeling saint wheels to and fro as the wind doth
blow. But be it known to you, that Michael the Archangel is the patron
saint of the city. This fine structure, although irregularly built, (for
the steeple is not in the centre of the building,) is nevertheless a
noble specimen of gothic-florid architecture. The building <i>La Maison de
Ville</i> occupied a space of forty years before its completion. One
hundred niches are occupied by statues<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>saints. The rooms in the
interior, where the estates of Brabant assemble, abound and are adorned
with beautiful specimens of the ancient Gobelin tapestry; they are
principally historical, three are after Janssens, the history of Clovis;
the inauguration of Philip the Good; and the abdication of Charles V. in
favour of his son Philip.</p>

<p>"Opposite to the town-hall of Brussels stands a remarkable structure,
called <i>La Maison du Roi</i>, built by order of the Archduke Albert and his
Duchess Isabella; her Highness conceiving that '<i>Notre Dame de Wavre</i>'
had not only most graciously delivered the good and royal city of
Brussels from the plague, but also had most humanely vouchsafed the
blessings of peace, erected in front of this mansion an image of the
Virgin, and placed underneath an inscription, which is as follows, and
the good prelate will translate it for you:&mdash;</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">'A Peste, Fame, et Bello, libera nos Maria Pacis; hic votum pacis</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">public&aelig;, Isabella consecravit.'<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></span><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> "The collegiate church, or cathedral, of Sainte Gudule,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is a
venerable and interesting pile, presenting a fine specimen of gothic
architecture. It was built about the year 1047, by Lambert, surnamed
Balderic, Duke of Brabant.</p>

<p>"The choir contains many fine paintings by Rubens, Vandyke, Philip of
Champagne, Artois de Haese, Mille, Janssens, and others. The sculpture
is also fine, produced by the chisels of Vervoont, Van Nerven, P.
Danckers, Van Delen, Henry du Quesnoy, Voorspoel, and others. The
windows of the chapel of the miraculous host, which is within the aisles
of Sainte Gudule, are formed of stained glass, and are exceedingly fine;
they were executed by Diepenbeke, Rogiers, De Vrint, and C. Floris. Many
of them were presents from crowned heads, from John XI. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>king of
Portugal, Maria III. queen of Hungary, Francis I. king of France, and
the emperor Charles V.; the window presented by Charles is behind the
altar of the miraculous Host.</p>

<p>"Many sovereign princes are interred within the walls of Saint Gudule,
among others the Archduke Albert, sovereign of the <i>Pays Bas</i>, and his
Duchess Isabella Clara Eugenia, Infanta of Spain. Here is the mausoleum
of Ernest, Archduke of Austria. John II. Duke of Brabant, and his wife
Margaret, daughter of Edward King of England, lie here interred. The
tomb is in the choir, it is of black marble, a lion of bronze, weighing
six thousand pounds, couches on the monument; the lion is the well-known
heraldic emblazonment of the house of Brabant.</p>

<p>"In the nave of Sainte Gudule are fourteen admirable statues carved in
stone, which are upwards of ten feet in height; they represent our
Saviour, the Virgin, and twelve apostles. Four of them are readily
distinguished as having been executed by the admirable skill of a
first-rate artist&mdash;they are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>the productions of Quesnoy. The altar of
the choir is exceedingly fine, and is principally composed of white
marble. Within the same choir formerly were held two chapters of the
order of the Golden Fleece, one was in 1435, and the other in 1516. Here
Charles V. conferred that order on Francis I. King of France.</p>

<p>"In nearly the centre of the choir stands that splendid and exquisite
specimen of sculpture in wood, the celebrated pulpit, which formerly had
belonged to the Jesuits of Lovaine. It is of carved oak, and was
executed by Henry Verbrugger of Antwerp. The subject is the expulsion of
Adam and Eve from Paradise by the Archangel, who in so doing extends the
flaming sword. The grief and compunction of our first parents is finely
conceived: while the angel expels Adam and Eve, his left hand gracefully
extended, with the right he smites with his sword the head of the
serpent, which is represented as eagerly devouring the apple. In front,
and on the convexity of the pulpit, an angel upholds a medallion of the
Virgin and the Child; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>in the concavity within is the station of the
preacher. Behind the pulpit arises the tree of life, two boughs of
which, curving right and left, support a circular canopy, which is
formed to represent clouds. The dove, as typical of the Holy Spirit, is
observed hovering over the preacher's head; groups of cherubim are
wreathed around, and the canopy is crested by upright figures of the
Virgin, the Saviour, and St. John. I have been thus minute, my dear
friend, as it would indeed be difficult to speak of this noble piece of
carving in sufficient terms of adequate praise.</p>

<p>"The governor's palace, the ancient residence of kings, who were
sovereigns of the <i>Pays Bas</i>, is situated in the park. It is an old and
venerable pile, with large gothic windows and various grotesque
decorations. It is called <i>La Palais de la Cour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The building was <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
begun in 1300 by John II. Duke of Brabant; in 1452 it was enlarged by
Philip the Good, and completed by his successors.</p>

<p>"On entering the palace one beholds a saloon of extraordinary grandeur,
from whence a gallery leads to the chapel, the architecture of which is
extremely fine, and of admirable symmetry. The other apartments in the
palace are extremely spacious, and of corresponding magnificence. The
exterior of the building is adorned with cupolas, towers, pinnacles, &amp;c.
A large area presents itself in front of the palace, which is handsomely
enclosed by ornamented ballustrades of stone, in good taste, and at
intervals columns arise, which are surmounted by statues of various
illustrious characters, viz.&mdash;Charles V., his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>son Philip, the Duke of
Burgundy, &amp;c. &amp;c. At the extremity of the park, near to the gate of
Louvaine, stands a handsome house, which the Emperor Charles V. caused
to be built subsequent to his abdication.</p>

<p>"The park, which presents an agreeable and fashionable promenade, is
laid out as a large garden with the greatest taste, intersected in every
direction by wide and handsome walks, on each side adorned with lofty
overshadowing lindens. The grounds are interspersed with numerous sunny
lawns, ornamented with fountains and numerous busts and statues, some of
which are exquisitely sculptured. There is a Magdalen by Quesnoy&mdash;the
statues of Diana and Narcissus by Gripelo&mdash;Venus and her doves by
Ollivier, &amp;c. In the centre of the park stands a magnificent marble
basin, well stocked with gold and silver fish. On either side of the
principal walk, which is a fashionable promenade, extend deep valleys,
shaded by noble lime trees, which afford a cool and agreeable retreat
from the summer's sun.</p>

<p>"There is another promenade which is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>fully as frequented as the park,
called '<i>l'Alle Verte</i>.' It is situated on the right bank of the canal,
which communicates with Antwerp, &amp;c. This walk and drive extend a mile
and half from the walls or ramparts of the city. The view from the canal
bridge is exceedingly beautiful. This public walk is delightfully shaded
by a triple row of trees planted on the banks of the canal. The scene is
rendered peculiarly delightful by the prospect which is presented to the
spectator's eye, the numerous villas in the vicinity, the passing and
repassing of boats on their way to the cities of the <i>Pays Bas</i> and of
Holland. These objects cannot fail to please, seen through the extensive
vista of the lofty limes, which opportunely afford a cool and covered
shade to the merry groups assembled in this favourite spot. Here crowds
of fashionables assemble before dinner, and revisit its walks in the
cool of the summer evenings. The <i>boulevards</i>, or ramparts, which are
planted with rows of trees on each side, also form an agreeable walk or
ride.</p>

<p>"The halls of <i>La Palais de la Cour</i> are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>adorned with a valuable and
select collection of paintings by the most celebrated and first-rate
Flemish masters. The library, which is open to the public, is placed in
the same building, and contains one hundred and twenty thousand volumes.
Among the manuscripts are a Greek Bible, a Terence, a Virgil, and a
Cicero.</p>

<p>"There are many handsome palaces in Brussels: one belongs to the house
of Orange, another to the Countess de Soissons, Prince Vaudement, Prince
de la Tour et Taxis; palace de Berghem, de Ligne, d'Epinoy, de Rubempre,
d'Aremberg, &amp;c., &amp;c. Some beautiful gardens&mdash;de Croy, de Hornes, de
Westerloo, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Many of the streets are of considerable extent, containing lofty houses
of handsome appearance, and withal having curiously decorated grotesque
gables. The exterior of some of the houses are plastered or painted
white, some are coloured yellow, and others a pale green colour.</p>

<p>"I must yet revert to the great market-place to observe (for I was too
much absorbed in my account of <i>La Maison de Ville</i> to do so before)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
that it is one of the most remarkable in Europe. It is a regular
parallelogram of great dimensions. Although the four sides differ
extremely in form and architecture, yet, nevertheless, they unite to
form a noble <i>coup d'&oelig;il</i>. Some inimitable, pieces of sculpture adorn
it.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>"The number of churches, chapels, convents, and monasteries in Brussels,
is very considerable. <i>Le grand Beguinage</i>, which is the most
remarkable, is a nunnery which was founded by <i>Sainte Begge</i>, daughter
of Pepin of Landen, from which lady it derives its name. This
institution resembles a small village; it is surrounded with walls, and
enclosed with a fosse. It contains a number of handsome streets, where
every nun has allotted her own dwelling. The usual number of the
sisterhood is from seven to eight hundred, and sometimes more. Every one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>takes charge of her own property. The vow of chastity is taken during
the time of their residence in the Beguinage; and when they leave the
nunnery they are free to marry. They are governed by four superiors
chosen from their own body, and a curate chosen by the Bishop of
Antwerp.</p>

<p>"The territory of Brussels includes a number of abbeys, convents, and
priories, of different religious orders. All these monasteries are
magnificently built, and their churches are very fine.</p>

<p>"The forest of Soignies contains three priories of regular canons of the
order of Saint Augustin:&mdash;1. The monastery of Groendal. 2. The priory of
Rouge Cloitre: in the library of this priory there is a considerable
collection of ancient manuscripts.&mdash;3. The priory of the Seven
Fountains.</p>

<p>"The beautiful forest of Soignies extends almost to the very gates of
Brussels. It contains sixteen thousand five hundred and twenty-six
acres. It is stored with abundance of game, and princes have often
within its extended wilds partaken the divertisements of the chase. This
noble forest belongs to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>corporation of Brussels. It supplies wood
in very great abundance as well for timber as for fuel.</p>

<p>"The principal commerce of Brussels consists in camlets, fine lace, and
tapestry. The population is estimated at about fifty thousand
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The ordinary language spoken here is either Flemish or
French; and indeed I may observe that the French spoken here (always, of
course, excepting <i>les gens de condition</i>) is, in sooth, ordinary
enough.</p>

<p>"I have observed some curious customs here, which according as they
recur to my recollection I shall detail to you, without assuming any
regular mode or form.</p>

<p>"In Brussels, and in other Belgic towns, I have seen dogs of the wolf
species or breed harnessed to small carriages, sometimes three abreast;
to others four, or even five abreast, and drawing very considerable
burdens. I have often seen baskets of fish, &amp;c. thus conveyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p> <p>"The kermise, or village-fair, is maintained with full as much <i>esprit</i>
as ever it had been in the days of Teniers, Ostade, or Van Bred&auml;el.
Music and dancing are the favourite pastimes of the Belgians of all
classes and descriptions; and indeed such is the extreme infatuation for
dancing that it is pursued more as a passion than sought as an
amusement. The lower class of the Belgians are extremely partial to
garlands of living flowers. Often these are suspended on a pole or tree,
around which they dance; and often are garlands to be seen suspended on
cords across a street, in the manner that lamps are hung in the good
city of Paris.</p>

<p>"The Belgic brazen pitcher is still to be seen either bearing home milk
to the dairy, or drawing water from the numerous wells in the vicinity
of this capital. The shape and form of this aforesaid pitcher is
familiar to those conversant with the paintings of Rubens, Cuyp,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Jourdaens, and Equilinus, in many of which it is introduced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> "The Brussellois dames wear the wedding ring in different guise from
what we do. We wear it on the third finger of the <i>left</i> hand, because
it is said, or sung, or supposed to communicate with the human heart by
means of some nerve or vein unseen; and the idea is not devoid of
prettiness. Here, however, the wedding ring is worn on the third finger
of the <i>right hand</i>, without any reason whatever being assigned for the
custom that I could ever hear or learn. Rings, it seems, here constitute
a favourite article in the dress of our sex, the fingers being often
covered with them. The lower class of females, citizens' daughters and
wives, and servant-maids, wear long, heavy pendants, or ear-rings, made
of some yellow metal to resemble gold, and so weighty that one's pity is
ever on the stretch, lest the patient's ears should succumb under the
burden. Large heavy crosses are likewise worn of the same kind of metal,
probably gilt brass, and suspended from a chain of the same
<i>materiel</i>.&mdash;Their peripatetic dress too is somewhat curious. They wear
a veil, or mantle rather, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>of black stuff or silk, which head habiliment
had been introduced by the Spaniards. It is called '<i>La faille</i>,' and is
worn like the <i>coiffeur&eacute;</i> placed on the Madona heads of Carlo Dolce,
Trevisano, Caracci, and Raffaele.</p>

<p>"The walking dress of the <i>bourgeois</i> is curious in its way, but not so
remarkable as the dress of the female as before described. His head is
enveloped in a hat of a size somewhat so cumbersome that it resembles
the kaplaken of a Dutch schipper, save and except with this essential
difference, that it is encompassed by a yellow tinsel band, and turned
up in front <i>&aacute; la co&ucirc;tume Espagn&oacute;le</i>. Around the neck and shoulders is
flung a large cloak, somewhat resembling, and evidently borrowed from
the <i>c&agrave;pa r&ograve;pa larga</i> of the Spaniard. A Flemish pipe, with its numerous
circling curves, is stuck in his lips, from whence clouds of smoke are
whiffed forth as he onward wends his way. The cloak reaches to the knee;
thence downward leather gaiters make their appearance; and a cane
obtruded from the dexter arm completes the walking habiliments of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Brussels' <i>bourgeois</i> of the present day.</p>

<p>"With almost unspeakable delight I told you of my dear Lord's return.
But now, my dear, pray prepare for more wonders still! Know then that at

understood from this, that throughout the numerous society of the human

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em"><span class="smcap">Cicero on Friendship.<br /></span></span></p>

<p>The Duke of Tyrconnel set forth from his splendid mansion in the <i>Rue
Ducale</i>, one sunny afternoon to take his usual equestrian exercise; and
while riding onward upon the <i>boulevards</i>, or ramparts of Brussels,
which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>are so delightfully shaded by trees, and enjoying the beautiful
scenery that surrounded him, his horse was rapidly pacing in a full
trot, and his Grace was proceeding without any attendant; when it so
chanced that his horse picked up a stone in one of the fore-feet. The
duke on the instant sprang from his saddle to free the horse's hoof from
this impediment; and while employed in the act, a stranger of noble
deportment and appearance advanced, who had been also enjoying the
fineness of the day in promenading this shady avenue. He most
courteously advanced, and tendered with peculiar politeness, and all the
meet grace and due courtesy of chivalry, to assist the duke by holding
the check-rein of the bridle. When, surprising to behold, the horse
almost instantly loudly neighed, and joyfully licked the stranger's
hand! Our readers will readily guess that this distinguished stranger,
whom this noble animal so instinctively recognised, was no other than
his late valiant master, the truly gallant colonel of the brave
Brandenburgh hussars, who had presented, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>upon their parting on the
plain of battle, this noble charger to the illustrious duke. The duke
and the stranger had met each other as deadly foes in the direful day of
civil war; and in the dreadful onset of personal combat, performing each
prodigies of valour, they encountered as foes, yet they parted as
friends!&mdash;respect, admiration, and love occupying those hearts so lately
swollen by hostile passions. They now were both mutually rejoiced once
more to meet, and soon were locked in a cordial embrace.</p>

<p>"This," said the duke, "certainly, gallant friend unknown, was wholly
unexpected&mdash;unhoped for quite!"</p>

<p>"Indeed," rejoined the stranger, "so may it please your Grace, it was
entirely as unexpected as it is now hailed and welcomed by me! And most
happy too am I to remark that no change, no vicissitude of war, nor
variance of politics, nor all the fleeting circumstances of these most
eventful times, have had effect or influence upon your Grace, whom I am
truly happy to observe are still the same, unchanged by circumstance or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>time&mdash;another Aristippus, whom every situation becomes and every
fortune adorns, be it prosperous or adverse!"</p>

<p>"With equal joy," replied the duke, "I behold thee too unchanged&mdash;the
same. Welcome, thrice welcome! my friend, my preserver! Although when
first we met it was the meeting of foes upon the hostile plain, I
wearing the badge of green, and thou the orange scarf of William. We met
as direful foes, but we parted with mutual regard and veneration. The
bow of heaven, which the Creator hath placed on high, is formed of those
glorious tints. It was in the shades of colour only in which we
differed. Ere long may the glorious bow of promise, of hope, and of
peace, irradiate Erin's western sky, until the glowing orange and the
glaring green shall melt and blend, and the primitive colours of the arc
of promise be softened down and subdued into the arc of peace!"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Amen, my lord, I say and repeat it most fervently from my heart; and
may heaven yet, in its kindest mercy, grant that some future great,
wise, and liberally-minded monarch of England, forsaking his ease and
quiet, may yet graciously visit the shores of your noble island, as the
harbinger of peace, crowned with the olive and the bay; and without the
aid of the <i>camera-obscura</i> of his courtiers, view with his own royal
eye the wants and sufferings of your poor islanders; and may his royal
and munificent heart heal the wounds and redress the sufferings of those
who can never cease to love him!&mdash;for the hearts of your countrymen are
grateful as they are brave. May they yet be placed within the pale of
that Constitution from which they are now debarred!"</p>

<p>"That, gallant Sir, indeed I devoutly wish; and most fully join and
concur in your philanthropic prayer! Wherever a contrary tendency to
what you assert has occurred in Ireland, it has arisen from oppression,
distress, and poverty. For wherever there is no home to be found there
can be no happiness; and it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>will be too surely found that an oppressed
and starving population are ever fatally prompt to join the standard of
rebellion; for surely the noise and bustle of a camp and the
soul-stirring trumpet are less appalling than the cries of starving
infants in their parent's wretched hovel, open and exposed to all the
winds of heaven, where can be found nor raiment, nor fuel, nor food! But
come, let us change to a more pleasing subject. There," holding up his
hand, "there, noble stranger, is your parting present which you gave me,
your ruby cameo ring of victory. By night and by day, I have never since
ceased to wear it in remembrance of him who gave it."</p>

<p>"And see," said the gallant stranger, (opening his waistcoat,) there is
the diamond star with which you so graciously presented me. It has never
been taken from my heart, where I placed it at the moment when you gave
it me!"</p>

<p>"I feel with force and with gratitude this kind expression of your
feeling; and now I needs must insist that you take back your <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>own noble
steed&mdash;he is yours again! He has become, I fain must own, like myself,
somewhat older&mdash;I will not say how long!&mdash;since last we parted, but it
is no matter! However the noble animal is still in his prime; he is
spirited, and you may observe he looks sleek, his coat is smooth, and
withal in good condition. Meantime, from this you may safely infer that
he hath had no severe master in me; and now I justly restore him to his
rightful owner."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, my Lord Duke, that cannot be! What once I have presented I
never can consent to receive back again&mdash;never! My Lord, it is utterly
impossible! But still I am not unwilling to compromise this mooted point
between us. If so your Grace be inclined, I shall feel much pleasure in
accompanying you occasionally in your equestrian excursions, and then I
will mount once more my <i>quondam</i> war-horse."</p>

<p>"With all my heart, most gracious Sir! And now, gallant and courteous
stranger, having redeemed my gage, I must, without further parley,
beseech to know thy name and rank, for such I am assured belongs to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>thee, to learn the name of him to whom I am so vastly&mdash;so deeply
indebted, and one whom I so duly estimate and honour!"</p>

<p>"That, my Lord Duke, is easily told, and in a very few words, if worthy
the inquiry.&mdash;My name is David Bruce, of Turnberry Castle, in Ayrshire,
a Baronet of Nova-Scotia, whom chance, or fate, or circumstances, all
combined, placed me a volunteer in the Brandenburgh hussars, where I
arose from that humble station to command the regiment, by merits not my
own."</p>

<p>"Pardon my interruption, Sir David Bruce," rejoined the duke, "that is,
in sooth, the only part of thy reply upon which I must put a decided
negative!"</p>

<p>"Well," replied the baronet, with a cheering smile, "your too favourable
construction, my Lord Duke, I may not be prepared to gainsay."</p>

<p>"No, no;" continued the Duke of Tyrconnel, "you could not&mdash;you
cannot&mdash;it is too palpable&mdash;it is too self-evident! Your courage and
powerful arm in the day of battle are strong as your lofty adamantine
mountains, while in peace your heart is soft and tender as the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
thistle-down of your own dear native land! Come, come, no reply, young
baronet, you must needs gang with me, as you say in Scotland; and we
must indeed be better acquainted!&mdash;You surely will not refuse to dine
with me to-day, when I shall have great pleasure to present you to my
duchess and my daughter as my friend, and the gallant preserver of my
life! Come, Sir David, no ambages, no circumlocution, no apology will I
take! Nay, nay, you must not hide behind the screen of modesty, and
denied or refused I must not be!&mdash;So I shall certainly expect you."</p>

<p>"Your Grace's invitation carries with it so much of interest and of
kindness, that it is not for me to refuse such inducements, and I
gratefully and willingly accede to it. My Lord Duke, I shall duly obey
your kind and hospitable summons."</p>

<p>"At three o'clock then," added the duke, "I shall hope for the pleasure
of seeing you at my mansion in the <i>Rue Ducale</i>."</p>

<p>Here the duke and the baronet cordially <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>shook hands, and parted; the
duke to resume his ride, and Sir David Bruce to complete his morning's
promenade.</p>

<p>Sir David Bruce, punctual to the hospitable summons, was the first guest
to arrive in due time at the <i>Maison de Tyrconnel</i>. As he entered the
drawing-room&mdash;"The knight of Chester walls, <i>le chevalier inconnu</i>," was
inadvertently vociferated by the duchess, accompanied by the all
wondering chorus of all that were present&mdash;"It is astonishing&mdash;&mdash;indeed
it is most astonishing!"</p>

<p>"Amazing, and quite surpassingly strange!" exclaimed Sir Patricius
Placebo, aided with one or two plentiful accompaniments of his
accustomed <i>recipe</i> from his magnificent Carolus snuff-box, which we
often noticed before.</p>

<p class="center">"DOSS MOI, TANE STIGMEN!</p>

<p>A hem!&mdash;Indeed quite astonishing!&mdash;most surpassingly strange!"</p>

<p>Most true it is that Sir David Bruce was the unknown stranger who
encountered the Duchess of Tyrconnel and family while promenading the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
walls of Chester; and he it was who so generously and disinterestedly
had relinquished the packet-boat which had conveyed them to Calais.</p>

<p>The duke said, introducing Sir David Bruce to his duchess, "permit me,
my dear, to present to you and the circle of my family, the noble
gentleman who now stands before you, Sir David Bruce of Turnberry Castle
in Ayrshire, to whose noble courage and generosity of heart I am
indebted for my life in the fatal battle of the Boyne, for such <i>I</i> must
ever consider it. Greet, then, I beseech you, and welcome him! in him
you behold the gallant preserver of my life, and him I hold and shall
reverence as my sincere friend so long as I shall exist!"</p>

<p>"My Lord Duke, I shall most faithfully obey your injunctions," added the
duchess; "but there I must not pause&mdash;there remains yet another account
of gratitude beside.&mdash;For exclusive of being the protector, my Lord, of
your life, to which, in the first instance, we all owe and duly feel the
deepest gratitude, yet still another debt of obligation <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>remains to be
discharged&mdash;I speak of the truly generous relinquishment of the packet
which had been engaged by Sir David Bruce to convey him to Calais, and
which he so nobly and generously relinquished to us! This can never be
forgotten, at least by us, although it possibly may not be so accounted
by Sir David Bruce."</p>

<p>"I really can see no very great merit, my Lady Duchess, in all this; I
conceive I only did what I ought to do, and that any one would have done
for ladies placed under similar embarrassments as you all were
circumstanced. Permit me to inquire how your Grace likes Brussels?"</p>

<p>"Why, well, Sir David, passing well, it is sometimes just a little
<i>trist&eacute;</i>, and the atmosphere, to be sure, is somewhat humid, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet," said Lady Aylesbury, (who had just then arrived,) with a
malicious smile, rudely interrupting her; "and yet, Madam, it has,
methinks, proved a very convenient <i>sejour</i> for some <i>gens de
condition</i>, who have for some years availed themselves of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>the
privilege, when it would not have proved altogether so prudent&mdash;&mdash;yes,
Madam; altogether so prudent, to have ventured elsewhere!"</p>

<p>"Oh, true, quite true, Lady Aylesbury, I had nearly forgotten it quite;
but for the verity of your remark, <i>your</i> spouse, as well as my own, can
fully attest, as both are placed in the same state of periclitation!"</p>

<p>Lady Aylesbury looked extremely awkward and mortified at this just
rebuke; she bit her nether lip, and hung down her silly head, writhing
under the deserved lash which her malicious remark had provoked.</p>

<p>Sir David Bruce, who happened to be at the other end of the room, and
seated next to Lady Adelaide, said to her in an under tone, "Lady
Aylesbury is so spiteful and malicious, that I am certain she must be
nearly related to Euryale, one of the Gorgons, own-sister to Medusa, who
was subject neither to old age nor death!"</p>

<p>"It would indeed appear so, Sir David," said Lady Adelaide, with a
sportive smile.</p>

<p>The Duke of d'Aremberg at this moment entered the room, who was
introduced in due <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>form to Sir David Bruce; they conversed together, and
seemed mutually pleased with each other.</p>

<p>The Duke d'Aremberg now approached the Duchess of Tyrconnel: "Pray, has
your Grace read the last essay from the pen of&mdash;&mdash;, and what does your
Grace think of its merits?"</p>

<p>"As I do, my Lord Duke, of all his writings, which are only calculated
to produce mischief, deep, dark, and dangerous; every parent should
dread him and his insidious pen&mdash;he is the high-priest of infidelity!"</p>

<p>"I knew and anticipated this, for I am always certain to obtain a
satisfactory and a decided opinion from your Grace, whose just judgment
I can so fully rely upon."</p>

<p>When this praise, so deservedly awarded to the duchess, met the ear of
Lady Aylesbury, with a malicious smile she turned her malignant, envious
eye on the duchess, to observe if her Grace was elated by this praise:
but she looked in vain. But these looks passed not unobserved by the
duchess, who deeply blushed, conscious of the mal-motives which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>directed them; and conscious too that she every way merited the praise
which was so justly bestowed: she felt pleased, but not elated; she felt
conscious of the talent she possessed, but both her judgment and her
modesty prevented her overrating them.</p>

<p>The dinner passed over pleasantly enough, and the gentlemen not tarrying
long over their glass, soon joined the ladies in the drawing-room. Lady
Adelaide was solicited to play and sing, and complied by seating herself
at the harpsichord, supported on the one side by the Duke d'Aremberg,
and on the other by Sir David Bruce, who was most attentive in turning
over the leaves of the music book, and he seemed quite charmed and
entranced with Lady Adelaide's singing. Indeed it was not difficult to a
bye-stander to discover that this day the Lady Adelaide had achieved a
double conquest, and that she held captive the hearts of the duke and
the baronet.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>A constant round of dinner parties in quick succession was briskly kept
up between d'Aremberg palace and Tyrconnel house. The anxiety of the
dowager duchess for the union of her son with the Lady Adelaide was
exceedingly great, and unremitting were her attentions and exertions for
its accomplishment.</p>

<p>"She would, upon that event," she often declared, "contentedly depart
from life, resigned in peace, when once her aged eyes <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>had beheld what
her soul had so often longed for, the union of an only son with the
lovely and transcendently accomplished daughter of the dear and early
friend of her youth." And the fact was, that the Duke and Duchess of
Tyrconnel were equally as anxious in their wishes for the union of their
daughter with the Duke d'Aremberg, as his noble and venerable mother,
looking upon the marriage as "a consummation devoutly to be wished!"</p>

<p>One morning, at an early hour, the Duchess d'Aremberg despatched a note
to Lady Adelaide, requesting that she would favour her godmother with a
visit, so soon as might prove convenient, at the conclusion of
breakfast, to the Lady Adelaide. "She was desirous," as her Grace
expressed herself, to speak to her dear god-child upon a subject which
was important to her happiness. She requested, therefore, that so soon
as it might prove convenient Lady Adelaide would have the goodness to
call upon her old friend and godmother."</p>

<p>An answer acquiescive to the above request was returned, and at the
appointed <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>time Adelaide waited upon the Duchess d'Aremberg, whom she
found seated on a low settee, that which, now varying in shape and
elevation, is in our modern days 'yclept a sofa. Before her Grace was
placed a small walnut spider-table. Her occupation was knitting a silk
purse: for even with the assistance of spectacles, she found it
difficult to read. At her feet reposed upon a velvet cushion her blind
and favourite lapdog Fidelle, who, hearing a stranger's steps to enter
the chamber, awoke from her slumbers, and saluted Adelaide with a volley
of barking, as loudly as age and infirmities permitted.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my dear Adelaide, my dearest god-child, whom I now gladly
embrace; and happy, too happy should I be to call thee by yet still a
dearer name than god-child: I would like to hear thee called daughter and
my son's duchess, while I the world forgetting, shall long by the world
be forgot. Yes, my dearest child, I fain would call thee by the still
fonder name of daughter, the wife of my beloved son, who from the first
moment in which he beheld thee, my <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>dear Adelaide, could no longer call
his heart his own!"</p>

<p>Adelaide felt dreadfully embarrassed. She reddened, and blushed up to
the very eyes; and indeed some time had elapsed before she could muster
up resolution enough to speak her sentiments.</p>

<p>As soon as she recovered her presence of mind, she replied: "How deeply
grateful to the duchess she felt for her numerous attentions and
kindnesses, and above all for the high honour which her Grace had
intended for her, but which she must most gratefully, respectfully, but
yet most decidedly, decline. She could never&mdash;she would never, give her
hand, without at the same time that it was in her power to bestow her
heart, and that she candidly acknowledged it was not now in her power to
give."</p>

<p>The duchess again, however, ineffectually renewed her solicitations, yet
with no more success than before, and concluded, as she thought, with
the unanswerable climax of her appeal: "Oh, think, my dearest Adelaide,
how very agreeable the union <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>would prove to the wishes and desires of
the Duke and Duchess of Tyrconnel, which so fully respond to my own!"</p>

<p>Adelaide, as soon as an opportunity presented, promptly availed herself
of it, arose, bade the duchess farewell, and departed homeward.</p>

<p>Upon her return she was met by her father, who conducted her into his
library, and addressed her thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"D'Aremberg has been here this morning while you were absent, my love,
with his mother, and he has made a proposition to us that has met with
decided approbation from both your mother and from me. The duke has
offered you his hand, and places his coronet and estates, which are
princely, Adelaide, at your feet! He is in every respect worthy of you,
descended as he is from a brave and noble race of ancestry, from which
indeed he has not degenerated. Young, valiant, generous, and noble&mdash;and
although bred in the camp, yet is his mind stored with the learning of
ancient Greece and Rome; he is an adept in modern languages; and as to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
his personal accomplishments and appearance, fame hath bruited it afar,
that fair ladies fully feel their force wherever d'Aremberg presents
himself. What says my Adelaide to this proposal?"</p>

<p>"Often and often, my dear father, have I heard you, and my mother
likewise, say, 'let no young woman ever give her hand in holy wedlock
who cannot also give her heart; if she gives her hand unaccompanied with
her heart, from that moment let her date the commencement of a wretched
life.' Now, dearest father, I cannot give my heart to the duke, and
therefore I consider that it would be dishonourable in me to give my
hand alone! I know well that it may be urged against me what and how
much I relinquish by this refusal&mdash;the elevated rank of a duchess, a
splendid fortune, and all the <i>accessoires</i> of high rank. Yes, I abandon
all these, most willingly relinquish them all!"</p>

<p>"Ay, sage Adelaide," severely said the duke, "<i>all</i> for a stranger!"</p>

<p>"Not so, my dear father! the Bruce is no stranger. His rank?&mdash;he who
preserved <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>my father's life amid the rage of battle, surely cannot be a
stranger! Gratitude and honour forbid it!&mdash;it is impossible. He too is
descended from a brave and royal race&mdash;the blood of kings pulsates in
his veins. I shall be silent on all the noble qualifications he
possesses; those that run may read them. And I will not, I confess,
blush when I say that I love the man who preserved your valuable life,
and that upon him my hopes, my happiness, my future fortune in life
depend! I feel, most duly and deeply feel, honoured by the duke's
proposal; however, I respectfully, yet decidedly decline it."</p>

<p>"Indeed!!&mdash;So young, yet so determined too!"</p>

<p>"I would not, my Lord, be the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of
Tyrconnel were I to waver, or act irresolutely."</p>

<p>"I see most clearly, Adelaide, how matters stand&mdash;'<i>All for love, or the
world well lost!</i>' In a word, your heart is pre-engaged. The Bruce!"</p>

<p>"I will not, my dearest father, deceive you. I cannot, I shall not deny
it. My <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>heart is truly engaged; and my affections are placed upon one
who is every way deserving of them, even were my rank higher than it
is."</p>

<p>"Have you ever, my child, observed a settled gloom which at times damps
the lustre of the Bruce's eye, and desolates his noble features? This
your mother and I have at times observed. You, doubtless, saw it not,
too much enamoured to make the discovery. But I have no manner of
hesitation in thinking, and declaring as my opinion, that Bruce has a
secret sorrow at heart;&mdash;and one day indeed, I must observe to you, that
your mother discovered him in tears."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear father, it was only love&mdash;retired, sincere, and
unpretending love!&mdash;Surely I have wept often myself. But then they were
rather tears of joy to reflect, when finally your objections and mamma's
were overcome, how blest, how happy I should be, united to the Bruce!"</p>

<p>"I perceive, Adelaide, when it is too late, that I have only to condemn
myself for <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>the incautious and imprudent introduction of Sir David
Bruce."</p>

<p>"Not so, my dear father, I saw and loved him before your
introduction&mdash;loved him at first sight! The declaration is strange, but
it is true. I know not how it was, but yet I know so it is, and I
honestly confess my weakness."</p>

<p>"And for this thy love at first sight!&mdash;this childish offspring of
an enthusiast's brain!&mdash;you seem fully resolved to relinquish the
noblest connexion in Belgium, of which princesses might be proud&mdash;a
warrior duke, descended from a long ennobled line of ancestry, his suit
denied, and the preference given to a stranger! Monstrous!&mdash;not to
be endured. Oh, such a damning fact ought not to have been disclosed to
a father's ear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Sir, say not so. Not to be disclosed to a father's
ear!&mdash;Oh, then, pray Sir, to whom should I disclose it, if not to
the ear of my parent? Ought I not hope to find in his bosom a friend, a
counsellor, adviser, and protector; in a word, a father! You saw,
Sir&mdash;you must have seen, that I <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>was beloved by the Bruce;
and I had not the art to disguise that I met, that I returned his love.
Time was, when a child, as I well remember, when you oft carried me on
your shoulder, and took me upon your lap: 'My Adelaide,' you then were
wont to say, 'you should ever consider your parents as your best
friends, the most interested in your welfare beyond all the world
besides. Oh, never look upon them as tyrants or oppressors; the tie of
affection between a child and its parents, from continued affection, is
stronger even than the filial bonds of nature herself. In doubt or
distress, therefore, ever look up to and consult your mother and me as
your natural protectors and advisers, in weal or in woe, as your
sincerest friends, rest you convinced, that you have upon earth; and be
sure to take no decided step whatever without consulting us, as you
shall ever most cordially receive, and candidly too, the best advice of
your mother and me, and always be assured of the warmth of the affection
of both your parents.' Now, my dear father, have I forgotten this
advice? say rather <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>intently I have treasured up all these
sayings in my heart, freshly stamped and impressed, as if it were only
yesterday that you had pronounced them. Rest assured, dearest Sir, of
this, that I shall never do a clandestine act; and when thus I solemnly
pledge myself to my parents never to marry without <i>their consent</i>, oh,
surely they will not&mdash;they could not be so severe or so unjust as
to require me to submit without my own!&mdash;more especially when my
heart is wholly disinclined&mdash;nay, and more, dislikes, and wholly
refuses assent. Say, should I hold forth my hand, dear and honoured
father, when my heart rejects, if not hates! Oh, say would it not be
most base and dishonourable; nay, more&mdash;it would be&mdash;(horrible
to reflect on!) it would be lying and prevaricating at the altar of God;
and there solemnly, but falsely, declaring that I would 'love, honour,
and obey' a man, however high his rank and great his worth, still that I
never loved, nor ever can love! No, no&mdash;a lie pronounced at the
altar of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> heaven!&mdash;I cannot do it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dearest Adelaide, indeed thou art my child&mdash;flesh of my
flesh, and blood of my blood. Believe me then, and despond not, my
dearest daughter, no aspiration to add to your rank or to increase your
fortune against your consent, shall ever again influence your mother or
me. Come then, my beloved, to thy father's arms, and never again shall
our opinions clash in collision. I glory in the name of father, when I
count that Adelaide is mine own dearest daughter; yea my only one! think
then no more, my dearest child, of what has gone past. I promise you
solemnly that you shall never again be teased or solicited upon this
topic, so think of what has passed but as the idle fantasy of a
frightful dream!"</p>

<p>This eventful day appeared to the much-dejected Adelaide as the longest
and most wearisome she had witnessed in the annals of her life. Although
still she deeply suffered, and succumbed beneath the ban of exile from
her native land and home, Adelaide likewise had deeply felt her pride
wounded to the very core at the outlawry and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>attainder of her
parents. More perplexing still yet seemed those moments of trial which
now had arrived, when Adelaide had to encounter and oppose the opinions
of a parent, in which, although completely triumphant, yet still her
success gave her pain, but not joy. And although the day ended, as
happily it did, in reconciliation, yet it had commenced in the
not-to-be-mistaken tone of high and angry displeasure.</p>

<p>Quite overcome, from thus differing so widely in opinion from those she
deeply regarded, oppressed with a quick and fevered pulse, and a frame
sadly exhausted, Adelaide gladly retired to repose, mentally exclaiming,
as she departed to her chamber,</p>

<p class="center">LETTER III.</p>

<blockquote><p>THE DUCHESS OF TYRCONNEL TO MRS. CARTWRIGHT.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left:20em"><i>Dated</i>, Antwerp, <i>June, 169</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam,</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p> <p>"Here we are at length arrived; we have been in this city a week, and
keep our head quarters at the Golden Lion, one of their principal inns,
where we are most agreeably and comfortably accommodated.</p>

<p>"Long since, indeed, had we planned and intended visiting this former
capital of Flanders, 'the Merchant City,' whose wealth once resembled
ancient Tyre, 'whose merchants were princes, whose traffickers were the
honourable of the earth!'<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But alas, how fallen is this even still
magnificent city from its pristine state of grandeur, opulence, and
population! that I should be inclined to apostrophize it in the words of
Jeremiah, 'How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! How
is she become a widow!&mdash;she that was great among the nations, and
princess among the provinces!'</p>

<p>"We had indeed long intended and projected a visit to this ancient,
interesting, and magnificent city; but that which is of easy
performance, what is in our daily power to execute, how often do we
delay and procrastinate to perform? So that too frequently in human life
such intentions are rarely or never accomplished!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p> <p>"Our mode of travelling from Brussels to this city was by the
Tr&euml;kschuit, (<i>literally draw-boat</i>,) or passage boat, which is drawn by
two horses; it was, in sooth, a most stately and magnificent barge which
conveyed us, with a handsomely furnished cabin beneath; the upper part
of the deck, appropriated for the <i>gens de condition</i>, was ornamented
with a tasteful awning of white and gold trellice work; the canopy which
surrounded it intended alike to keep aloof rain or sunshine. The whole
of this splendid barge was gilt, and most tastefully decorated; while at
the prow the Belgic lion (the armorial bearing of Flanders) blazed forth
in burnished gold, flinging its splendid image upon the bosom of the
waters as majestically it moved along its watery way. I must indeed say
that it strongly reminded me of the beautiful passage in our immortal
bard of Avon, where he describes, with so much poetic force and fire,
the progress of Cleopatra sailing down the river Cydnus. But pray, I
beseech you, do not think that I conceive the duke to be Marc Antony, no
more than I compare myself to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>Cleopatra, although our stately barge
reminded me of hers!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">'The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Burn'd on the water; the poop was beaten gold! &amp;c.'<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>At the further end of the vessel, from the awning of the Tr&euml;kschuit,
were stationed a band of minstrels, who, upon the bell having been rung
to announce our departure, right merrily commenced the harmony of sweet
sounds, repeating songs and glees, accompanied by musical instruments,
every half hour, which fully broke the monotony of our voyage, rendered
so agreeable by such sweet melody as to shorten apparently the distance
from Brussels to Antwerp. And as to our dinner, which we had piping hot
and excellent, in the cabin below, Sir Patricius Placebo, who is quite
<i>au fait</i> on such occasions, loudly exclaimed, (and he is indeed,
accredit me, my good friend, by no means an indifferent judge,) 'I vow,
'fore Jove,' said he, 'the dinner was excellent, every thing in its kind
was good, the wines excellent, and saving and except at the duke's
mansion in the <i>Rue Ducale</i>, he had,' he avowed, 'not partaken of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
so delicious a dinner since his <i>sejo&ugrave;r</i> in Flanders!'</p>

<p>"This he concluded, of course, with his never failing favourite Greek
quotation&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'<span class="smcap-all">DOSS MOI, TANE STIGMEN!</span>'</p>

<p>and his accustomed chorus: 'Ha, humph!&mdash;Ha, hum!'</p>

<p>"Although diminished in her population, and depressed in her commerce,
Antwerp is still a noble city. You need not, however, my dear friend,
apprehend that I shall enter into a critical detail, which fault I am
rather apprehensive (although your kindness expresses the contrary) I
have already committed in my two former letters, which have engrossed
too much of your time and attention, by my elaborate description of
other cities; but believe me truly that in what now I write, I shall be
both brief and sententious in this rapid sketch which I am about to
undertake:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The view of Antwerp, seen by the intervention of the river Scheldt, is
extremely imposing and magnificent, its numerous domes, cupolas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a>
</span> palaces, and spires, and towering above all, over town and tide, the
exalted spire of <i>Notre Dame</i>, the finest in the world, strikes the
spectator with awe and admiration. This venerable city was once the
emporium and the envy of all Europe; but now, alas! solemn, gloomy
silence, pervades her splendid, spacious, but unfrequented streets; the
busy hum of men no more is heard amid her deserted stately palaces, and
silent and solitary that noble exchange,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> where once were congregated
the most wealthy merchants of the world!</p>

<p>"You may possibly have heard of the well known and authenticated fact of
a wealthy merchant of this city, by name Jean Deans, who nobly supplied
the emperor Charles V. with the immense loan of two millions of money;
the merchant then prepared a magnificent banquet, which he gave upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>emperor's self-invitation; when the magnificent merchant, at the
termination of the repast, flinging the bond into a spicy conflagration
of cinnamon, exclaimed the meanwhile&mdash;'I feel, Sire, sufficiently repaid
by the honour which your Majesty has so graciously this day conferred
upon me; fire has cancelled the imperial obligation. However, Sire, I am
<i>your</i> debtor now, which I ever shall remain, for the honour which your
Majesty has this day conferred on me!'</p>

<p>"Antwerp has produced such an host of illustrious men, that to enumerate
all would truly prove a tiresome task. The names of Bomberg, Plantin,
and Moretus, are identified with the art of printing. Antwerp also gave
birth to Grammaye, the historian; to Teniers, the Proteus of his art; to
Sneyders; and likewise to Jordaens; while the mighty names of Rubens<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
and Vandyke fling a halo of glory around the ancient city of Antwerp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>"Already we have visited every place worthy of been seen, have viewed
every object of curiosity: museums, libraries, cabinets, galleries, and
collections of paintings: have inspected palaces, monasteries, churches,
and cathedrals, where are to be seen many fine paintings of the first
class of excellence. Yesterday we visited the royal academy of
paintings, and in the chamber where the professors assemble, is placed
the memorable chair that had once belonged to 'the prince of painters,'
to the great and unequalled Rubens; it is formed of carved wood,
surmounted with lions' heads, and covered with red Morocco leather, with
the initials of his illustrious name, and his armorial bearings placed
on the back of it. My enthusiastic Adelaide fairly enthroned herself
therein, and there she sat, and would still have sat, and how long the
genii of poesy and painting can only tell, until I had to give my dear
daughter a most maternal tap upon the shoulder to admonish that we were
waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Next we visited the altar and tomb of Rubens, which is placed in the
church of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>Saint James; here my enwrapt enthusiastic Adelaide was so
delighted, that I really expected every moment to see her doff her
sandals, and, bare-kneed, advance a pilgrim of genius to do homage at
the shrine of this mighty man. The tomb and altar are highly and richly
decorated with marble. A splendid painting from his own inimitable
pencil adorns the altar, which forms the central compartment; it
represents the infant Saviour placed on the knees of his mother; Saint
Jerome is stationed on the right of the Virgin; two female figures,
which are portraits of the two wives of Rubens, Elizabeth Brants and
Helena Forman, are placed before the principal figure, which represents
the painter himself in armour, personifying Saint George; the dragon,
pierced to death, lies at his feet, while, with much dignity and the
triumph of victory, he holds erect to heaven his triumphant banner. In a
<span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has nich">niche,</span> crowning the monument, is placed a marble statue of the Virgin,
looking up in the ardent act of devotion, and holding with fervour to
her breast a crucifix. This famous statue was sculptured by Francis <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Flamand, and brought from Rome by Rubens himself; it is a work of great
excellence, but placed quite too high for the eye sufficiently to
appreciate its superior merit.</p>

<p>"But, my dear friend, were I to dwell upon and detail all the various
and excellent specimens of the works of art to be witnessed in this
ancient and venerable city, I should fill volumes, and weary you to
death. A few more 'last words' concerning Rubens, and I have done.</p>

<p>"To-day we visited the site of the palace which had belonged to this
most distinguished and accomplished character. The palace no more
exists, but some few shattered arches and architectural remains in his
garden are still to be seen, and upon these we gazed, as on holy relics,
with awe and respect.</p>

<p>"This prince of painters was a learned scholar, artist, politician, and
a finished gentleman; ennobled by genius, birth, and rank, this
distinguished man was selected as the ambassador of renowned kings, and
decorated by them with honours, well and deservedly bestowed; he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
returned at the conclusion of his embassy to his native land. His
education had been liberal, and his erudition was great, he could
fluently speak six different languages; his manners, habits, and modes
of life, were those of a prince. His admiration of men of talent was as
unbounded as was his generosity manifested to them;&mdash;his friendship for
the great Vandyke is well known.</p>

<p>"This poor tribute I could not but pay to the illustrious Rubens, whose
virtues and whose genius must ever elicit the praise and the admiration
of this and every succeeding age!</p>

<p>"I had the pleasure to receive your very kind and friendly letter from
Bath, but grieve to find that the good bishop has had so severe a
visitation from his old inveterate tormentor, the gout; however, I trust
that the healing waters and springs of Bai&aelig; may fully aid his recovery,
and renovate his health.</p>

<p>"You must know that my Adelaide has <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>received proposals in marriage from
no less than three personages: from the eldest son of the Earl of
Aylesbury, which she instantly very properly declined, for he was a
prating coxcomb, a painted popinjay. The next matrimonial proposition
came from the Duke d'Aremberg, a most amiable young nobleman, an
alliance, in every respect, 'most devoutly' to be wished for, and gladly
accepted. But so thought not Adelaide. Her father and I, without forcing
her inclinations, were most desirous that this union should take place;
we considered his elevated rank, the first duke in Brabant, his lordly
fortune, his great personal worth, added to his numerous
accomplishments. But strange and unaccountable to relate, without
hesitation, my Adelaide refused him! The third matrimonial proposal came
from 'the knight of Chester walls,' '<i>le chevalier inconnu</i>,' but now
well known as Sir David Bruce, a baronet of Nova-Scotia; and which
offer, it appears, was most graciously accepted by Adelaide, but under
correction and approbation of her parents. Which said match is most
likely never to be accomplished, inasmuch that the Duke of Tyrconnel <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
has solemnly declared, that until his attainder is rescinded, and a free
and unqualified permission given him by the higher powers to return to
his native country and his paternal towers, he is determined never to
give his assent to the union of Sir David Bruce with the Lady Adelaide.
Thus I fear that the lovers have placed themselves in a very awkward and
distressing predicament, as no two events can possibly be more distant,
and hardly ever expected to be attainable!</p>

<p>"It is impossible that I should not look up with the highest respect to
the character and the noble qualities of the Duke of Tyrconnel, the
unshaken friend of his sovereign, whether seated on his throne, or an
exile from his realms; uncorrupted by prosperity, unshaken and unchanged
by adversity; comporting himself with that equanimity of temper, that
what Horace<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> says of Aristippus <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>would apply to him&mdash;one whom every
change, whom every station, and every event became!</p>

<p>"How days, and months, and years, my friend, advance, proceed, and are
gone like the track of an arrow through the buoyant air, or a keel
cutting its foaming course through the vasty deep! Alas, my dear,</p>

<p class="center">'We take no note of time but by its loss.'</p>

<p>Seven years have passed by since our sojourn in Brabant&mdash;sad and
solitary;&mdash;oh no, I cannot be so wicked&mdash;so ungrateful, as to assert it
has been; that portion of time having fled in the happy home of my
beloved Lord, and along with my <i>alter idem</i>, my second self, as Cicero
expresses it, my adored Adelaide. Oh, unjust indeed I should be to
complain; however, I may confess, <i>en passant</i>, that the climate of
Brussels is somewhat humid, especially during the autumnal months; and
the society somewhat <i>trist&eacute;</i>, with a notable lack of public amusements;
but believe me I truly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>feel no loss in the deprivation of the latter.
Oh, my friend, once more freely to breathe my native mountain air!&mdash;once
more to reach the verdant isle, and again to inhabit the towers of
Tyrconnel! then were my Adelaide suitably mated and matched, my sum of
human happiness would be consummated. We purpose staying here a few days
longer, and then set out on our return, by land, to our mansion in the
<i>Rue Ducale</i> at Brussels.</p>

<p>"I know well, my dear and kind friend, how warmly interested you and the
good bishop are in every thing regarding or connected with our interest
and happiness, and whenever I can write to you upon the subject,
although poor exiles as we are, I feel not very sanguine in my hopes of
having cause of speedily so doing; yet should a change in our fortunes
occur, write I shall assuredly&mdash;you may depend upon it!</p>

<p>"Having now, I fear, fairly tormented you with this long and tiresome
epistle, I shall not add another word but what I know you will readily
believe, which is, that <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>wherever I am, wherever I go, be assured that
I remain</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em">Your constant and truly</span></p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 12em">Affectionate Friend,</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 12em">(<i>Signed</i>) <span class="smcap">Katherine Tyrconnel</span>."</span></p>

<p>The Duke of Tyrconnel and his family, and particularly the lovely
Adelaide, were delighted with the tranquillity of Brussels, and often,
accompanied by Sir David Bruce, they gladly sojourned at the ancient
chateau of Tervuren, about three leagues distant from Brussels, and
situated in the forest of Soignies, where a cold collation was
frequently prepared for them, and which they not only seemed to relish,
but were happier in its enjoyment than although it had been served to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
them on golden plate in palaces of kings.</p>

<p>Upon one of these pleasant excursions the duke, who was riding next Sir
Patricius Placebo, while passing through the forest his Grace said: "I
never, Sir Patricius, felt so happy&mdash;so far, at least, as regards my own
personal feelings&mdash;as now I do, and always feel upon these our little
expeditions, if I could forget&mdash;if indeed I ever could forget that my
royal master is an exile from his dominions! Save this consideration, I
repine not for myself, nor would I exchange social leisure and rural
retirement for all the pomp of camps and courts, and power political."</p>

<p>"I fully concur," rejoined Sir Patricius, "in your Grace's sentiments,
and in the words of a true <span class="smcap">Amicus</span> I may thus reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">"I would not change it: happy is your Grace<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">That can translate the stubbornness of fortune<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">Into so quiet and so sweet a style."<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The duke now rode up to the side of the carriage to make some
observations to the duchess, when Sir David said:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think, nevertheless, good Sir Patricius, with old truth-telling
Persius,</p>

<p class="center">'At pulchrum est digito monstrari, et dicier <span class="smcap-all">HIC EST</span>!'<br /> </p>

<p>that it could not surely have been altogether so very disagreeable to be
pointed out as a distinguished person of rank, who was respected by the
multitude, and one every way so deserving of it; and to hear their
hoarse, but gladdened voices exclaim, 'make way there! room, room for
the duke!"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir David, I entirely concur in this opinion with you; for
methinks my good and kind master is somewhat too soon disposed to retire
from this most wicked, sinister, and abominable world, and to be as
sick, forsooth, of pomp and praise as ever <i>Henri Quatr&eacute;</i> was of a
partridge!"</p>

<p>The pleasure party for Tervuren Castle and park was thus arranged:&mdash;The
duke, Sir Patricius, and Sir David, were on horseback, and led the van.
Then followed one of the duke's carriages, with outriders, in which were
the duke's sisters, the Ladies Letitia and Lucy, accompanied by two
grand <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>nieces of the Duchess Dowager d'Aremberg. Then came on another
coach of the duke's, in which were seated the duchess and Lady Adelaide.
Footmen, mounted, closed the cavalcade. The Duke d'Aremberg had been
invited to the collation; but it appeared that he was gone into Holland,
on a visit at the Hague, for which he had immediately departed, upon his
proposals having been rejected by the Lady Adelaide.</p>

<p>The ancient chateau of Tervuren<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> had been built by the dukes of
Brabant. It was situated in the forest of Soignies, and distant two
leagues and a half from Brussels. It was remarkable for its antiquity,
and all that sombrous magnificence which pertained to those castles,
whose foundations were laid in the days of chivalry. It was
circumvallated by a deep and extensive fosse, broad and deep enough
almost indeed to be dignified with the name of lake. Four several
draw-bridges connected the castle with the park, and pleasure-boats were
stationed on <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>the water. Here too was seen, sailing majestically along,
the mild and gentle swan, the peaceful king of water birds, guarding his
watery realm in tranquil peace, unawed by the bird of Jove, with whom he
dares to combat, and even to conquer, although seeking not the
conflict.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Indeed the swans constituted the chief ornament of the artificial lakes
that were dispersed through the park and pleasure-grounds, and besides
animated and adorned the gloomy fosse that sullenly surrounded Tervuren
Castle.</p>

<p>The grand saloon of this once royal residence was of an extraordinary
size and dimensions. The ceiling and wainscot were formed of rich and
beautifully carved oak, which attracted much admiration. There were also
two other state apartments, the walls of which were decorated with
tapestry from designs of Rubens and the younger Teniers. And exclusive
of these three large state apartments, this once <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>royal chateau could
boast of no other internal splendour or decoration. The park, however,
was fine, crowned with lofty woods, and the pleasure grounds adorned
with the united efforts of taste and art, which failed not to yield
delight to the spectator. Here, during the summer months, the duke and
duchess and family, with parties of their friends, frequently visited;
and having partaken of a cold dinner previously prepared, have strolled
forth in the calm of evening, and lingered until a late hour amid the
groves and pleasure grounds, listening with much delight to the warbling
of the nightingale.</p>

<p>The entertainment given this day was at the sole expense of Sir
Patricius Placebo, who felt exceedingly gratified thereat, as he
expressed himself, for the permission thus granted him by his noble
patron, and said:</p>

<p>"Accredit me, noble Sir, under your sage decidement, I flatter myself
that this day's entertainment will sufficiently prove that there are
those living who fully understand the <i>scavoir vivre</i>&mdash;ay, critically
well as ever Lucullus or Apicius did; for, ahem,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p><p class="center"><span class="smcap-all">DOSS MOI TANE STIGMEN!</span></p>

<p>as doubtless, when the important hour of dinner arrives, I trust that
your Grace will be free to&mdash;&mdash;But <i>tempus et hora</i>&mdash;let the time and
season tell! I shall not boast too soon, but leave it to your Grace's
discreet arbitrament! That will be, my Lord, the <i>tempus opportunum</i>
perfectly to illustrate <i>the noble theory of luxury</i>! at which methinks
your Grace shall marvel much."</p>

<p>"For me to dissent," rejoined the duke, "my good Sir Patricius, from the
two high authorities whom you have cited, would be somewhat too like
Diogenes, surrounded with sunshine, yet growling in his tub; and treason
prepense <i>certes</i> against the noble culinary art!&mdash;besides ingratitude
to mine honoured host of Tervuren!</p>

<p>"I know full well that Apicius C&aelig;lius, whom you quote as an authority,
Sir Patricius, wrote a learned essay, <i>de Arte Coquinaria</i>&mdash;a treatise
on the culinary art; and that he may well be considered as the <i>Pontifex
maximus Epicuri</i>. But respecting and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>regarding the great Lucullus,
whose distinction arose from a higher flight than a mere knowledge of
the culinary art, I must observe, <i>en passant</i>, that I flatter myself I
do somewhat resemble that great character, namely, in my fondness for
retirement, which I only regret I had not sooner cultivated, as it would
have placed me above the reach of ambition, and beyond the pangs of
care!</p>

<p>"Indeed had I been born in Belgium, I am tolerably certain that my past
life, instead of being occupied and engrossed in the turmoil of courts
and camps, would tranquilly have passed over in pastoral seclusion; for
man, Sir Patricius, say what we may,</p>

<p class="center">'Proud man! though dressed in little brief authority,'</p>

<p>is after all but at best the poor and passive creature of time, place,
period, and circumstance!&mdash;and, under this firm conviction, I know I
should have wielded the shepherd's crook, and not the marshal's
truncheon!"</p>

<p>"My Lord Duke, there is no gainsaying your Grace's <i>dictum</i>, which, in
sooth, is fully illustrated by the beautiful lines of gentle Master
Waller:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

   <div class="verse">And he who subdued the world had been<br /></div>
   <div class="verse">But the best wrestler on the green!'"<br /></div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>The shaft duly struck its intended mark, and the duke evidently seemed
pleased, for flattery, although, generally speaking, it is often rather
coarsely served up,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
   <div class="verse">"Yet oft we find that men of wit<br /></div>

 </div>
</div>

<p>The moment so important to Sir Patricius had now arrived&mdash;the time of
dinner. The castle clock chimed forth the second hour, the baronet's eye
sparkling with delight as he beheld the long extended commissary train
of eatable artillery enter the <i>salle de manger</i>; many an ahem! and</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap-all">DOSS MOI TANE STIGMEN!</span></p>

<p>were exultingly ejaculated forth when the dinner was duly arranged; and
with delight he beheld the delicious banquet that lay before him, while
gladly he observed the numerous delicacies which were duly recorded in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
his <i>carte du jour</i>, along with the choicest wines, from <i>Malvoisie de
Madere</i> to "imperial Tokay." Various choice <i>hors d'&oelig;uvres</i> were
served up, and succeeded by a splendid course of <i>entremets</i>, which
concluded with a grand dessert.</p>

<p>Since the royal times of the Dukes of Brabant such an entertainment had
not been witnessed in Tervuren Castle.</p>

<p>But there were luxuries this day produced which are not to be found in
the <i>carte du jour</i> of either the famous <i>restaurateurs</i> Very, or
Beauvillier, or at the celebrated <i>Rocher de Cancale</i> of modern Paris:
<i>videlicet</i>&mdash;ortolan pies, the celebrated <i>p&acirc;tes des foies gross</i><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> of
Strasburgh, and the no less famed <i>p&acirc;t&egrave;s &aacute; croute de seigle des
perdreaux rouges aux truffes</i>, the far-famed Perigord pies, made of the
red-legged partridge, and constructed by the confectionary skill and
tact of the scientific <i>pattissiers</i> of Perigeux, the capital <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>of the
province of Perigord, in France,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> a luxury well known, and often sent
as acceptable presents to peers and princes.</p>

<p>The worthy baronet paid every attention and respect to his honoured
guests, and received much praise for a banquet so <i>recherch&egrave;</i>, but it
was the opinion of all that it was quite too <i>magnifique</i>, and totally
out of character both with time and place.</p>

<p>The repast concluded, the ducal party sallied forth to enjoy their
favourite walk in the delightful groves and gardens of Tervuren; and
entering a summer-house they were agreeably surprised once more with the
unceasing attention of Sir Patricius, for they here found tea, coffee,
refreshments, fruits, liqueurs, &amp;c., all ready for their acceptance. So
soon as tea was over they again resumed their promenade. It was a
charming summer evening in the beginning of June, the sky was clear and
serene, the leaves of the surrounding forest were unruffled by a breath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>of air, the very zephyrs seemed at rest; the silent lake lulled to
repose, presented, as in a mirror, each object deeply and distinctly
reflected on its glassy surface; it seemed great Nature's holiday; while
enraptured with delight they listened to the shrill mellow warbling of
the nightingale, increased by the silence of the scene, and the
tranquillity of the evening.</p>

<p>Upon this happy afternoon, enjoyed so rationally amid the tranquil
secluded grounds and pleasure parks of the once royal castle of
Tervuren, Lady Adelaide and Sir David Bruce, having been left aloof from
the party, had taken a seat in one of the numerous summer-bowers which
adorned the grounds, and in the day-time afforded shelter from the
burning blaze of a Belgic sun, where, while the nightingale sweetly
sung, Adelaide said, with a cheerful smile, "My dearest Bruce will not
surely prove jealous if for a moment forgetting him, (for it could only
be for a moment,") she added, with emphasis, "that here I pay the homage
of <i>my</i> song to the sweet nightingale, the nightly songster of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>grove; the lark is the sunny bird of morn, but the sweetly plaintive
nightingale is exclusively the minstrel of the night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;oh, no, my dearest, my beloved Adelaide! come, pray, produce
thy tablets, for I too am as much enraptured as thou canst be, with this
sweet vocal minstrel of the night!"</p>

<p>"As soon done as said;&mdash;see, here they are, and accept them, for they
are yours;&mdash;if they should please my dearest Bruce, I am fully repaid!"</p>

 </div>
</div>

<p>"Thanks, my Adelaide, for thy sweet verses, I like them much, very much
indeed, with the exception, perhaps, of the last line, <i>the elegies of
love</i>; pray, my dear, you leave such <i>larmoyant&egrave;</i> lucubrations to the
Hero and Leander of romance, or to their own Ovid; but, oh, let all
<i>his</i> '<span class="smcap-all">FASTI</span>' [i. e. festivals] be thine! while succeeding years shall
be noted with chalk in the bright calendar of thy days! <i>Felices ter et
ampli&uacute;s essint!</i>&mdash;'The elegies of love!' Why thou fain then believest,
my <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>Adelaide, that poor Philomela, as the tuneful Maro wrote,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> pours
forth her nightly plaint, and although she so sweetly sings, yet still
thou fanciest the thorn of the rose rankles in her breast, while she
renews at eve her melancholy song!"</p>

<p>"Such, at least, was the opinion of the poets. But come, Sir David, let
us hasten to join our friends, who will wonder what hath become of us."</p>

<p>They now rejoined the duke and duchess, and the carriages and horses
having been brought out, they set forth on their return to fair
Brussels.</p>

<p>But, alas! according to the Flemish proverb,</p>

<p class="center">"Alle wereldsch Goedaardig is Vergankelyk!"</p>

<p>All worldly good is fleeting and transitory! as we now have but too just
occasion to illustrate by facts. The ducal party had scarcely entered
upon the road, which is flanked by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>the thickest and most densely wooded
part of Soignies forest, the stillness of the solitude disturbed only by
the horse tramps, and the rolling of the duke's carriages, when, upon
the sudden, a shrill and loud re-echoing whistle issued from the forest,
and was instantly chorused by a number of harsh voices fiercely crying
<i>hui, hieu, huit</i>; when, almost instantly, a troop of armed horsemen,
unquestionably banditti, collecting from different points, thundered in
full gallop to where the signal was sounded. The banditti amounted in
number to about eleven or twelve, so far indeed as observation could be
made amid the darkness of the night, which was then setting in, and
increased by the deep and gloomy shadows of the surrounding forest; the
confusion too and terror caused by this unexpected appearance, increased
by the clamorous screams, and the many females who fainted, at the
approaching conflict, which was now beyond a doubt. The banditti came up
in full gallop, and forming into ranks, advanced within a few paces of
the cavalcade, and intercepting its progress, presented their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
petronels<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> full-cocked; and one, the leader no doubt, meanwhile
fiercely exclaiming in Stentorian voice, '<i>Basta senors, basta senors!</i>'
then pulling the triggers, discharged their petronels. Opposed to them
were the noble company on horseback, and the attending footmen and
outriders; these were only armed with long horse-pistols, which,
however, told full well, for Sir David Bruce valiantly brought down a
brace of the banditti, who soon cowered to earth. The duke wounded two
others, who were with difficulty removed. Sir Patricius, albeit, who
would have preferred an old acquaintanceship with his Carolus' snuff-box
at this hour, was equally as successful.</p>

<p>However, we are indeed sorry to narrate that Sir David Bruce was thrown
from his horse in consequence of excessive pain which he suffered from a
wound received in his right shoulder from a ball fired from one of the
petronels of the banditti.</p>

<p>It was all a dreadful scene of noise, darkness, confusion, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
distress! The duchess, Adelaide, and the Ladies Letitia and Lucy, were
infinitely alarmed; but the nieces of the Duchess d'Aremberg fainted,
and it was some time before they could be restored to animation.</p>

<p>Fortunately at this critical point of time a patrole of <i>Gens
d'Armes</i> approached, who had been for some days in search of the said
banditti, when instantly applying their rowels, with small ceremony, to
the ribs of their steeds, the banditti fled, dispersing in every
direction throughout the entanglements of the forest.</p>

<p>Sir David Bruce, who had received a severe gun-shot wound, was, without
delay, placed in the same carriage with the duchess and Lady Adelaide;
every remedy that could on the instant be procured having been applied
as styptics to stop the flowing of blood, and contrary to all his warm
remonstrances; but we will not undertake to say that it was contrary to
his inclination he was placed within the same carriage with Adelaide;
the coachman was enjoined to proceed at a slow <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>pace, the <i>Gens d'Armes</i>
meanwhile escorting them, nor quitted the cavalcade until they safely
had entered Brussels by the Namur gate; whence ten minutes, or so,
brought the ducal party, who had so lately enjoyed a scene of pleasure,
so suddenly transmuted into a scene of woe, to Tyrconnel house in the
<i>Rue Ducale</i>.</p>

the late Mr. Cooper Walker: "When that unfortunate Prince, James II.,
landed at Kinsale, his friends who awaited his arrival on the sea shore
received him with the <i>Rinceadh-Fada</i>, or Irish dance, the figure and
execution of which delighted him exceedingly. This was the figure: Three
persons abreast, each holding a corner of a white handkerchief, first
moved forward a few paces to slow music; the rest of the dancers
followed two and two, a white handkerchief held between each. Then the
dance began, the music suddenly changing to brisk time; the dancers then
passed with a quick step under the handkerchief of the three in front;
they wheeled round in semi-circles, forming a variety of pleasing and
animating evolutions, interspersed at intervals with <i>entr&egrave; chants</i>, or
cuts; they then united, and fell back again in their original places
behind, and paused. Perhaps the classical reader will find&mdash;and we think
he may&mdash;a similarity between our <i>Rinceadh-Fada</i> and the festal dance of
the Greeks."&mdash;<i>Historical Memoirs of the Irish Bards</i>, 4to., Dublin,
1786, pp. 151, 152, 154.</p>

the nest, but after she had been inured to liberty, and preying for
herself. Haggard-hawks are hard to be tamed and brought under
discipline. The haggard-falcon is also called <i>Peregrine-falcon</i>,
passenger and traveller, from its wandering more than any other sort of
its kind; it is strong, courageous, hardy, and persevering. This bird is
distinguished from the common falcon as being larger, &amp;c. &amp;c. The
haggard-falcon, when wild and unreclaimed, takes the greatest liberty of
all other birds, living either by land or sea; and formed of such
absolute power, that wherever she comes all flying fowl stoop under her
subjection.</p></div>

horse-races of Chester are run, cannot well be passed over in silence.
The Dee, after quitting the contracted pass at the bridge, flows beneath
an incurvated clayey cliff, and washes on the right a fine and extensive
meadow, long since protected against its ravages by a lofty dike: it is
called Rood-eye.</p>

<p>"The name of this spot is taken from <i>Eye</i>, its watery situation, and
<i>Rood</i>, the cross which stood there, whose base is still to be seen. On
this place the lusty youth of former days exercised themselves in the
manly sports of the age, in archery, running, leaping, and wrestling; in
mock fights, and gallant and romantic triumphs.</p>

<p>"A <i>standard</i> was the prize of emulation in the sports celebrated on the
<i>Rood-eye</i>. But in the year 1609 the amusements took a new form; and
under the reign of the peaceful <span class="smcap">James</span> the youthful cavaliers laid aside
their mimic war, and horse-racing commenced.</p>

<p> "The first prizes we hear of after the suppression of the triumph, were
a bell and bowl to be run for on Saint George's day, which were provided
in 1609 by Mr. Robert Amery, formerly Sheriff of the city, and were
brought down to the <i>Rood-eye</i> with great solemnity. This seems to have
been the origin of the plate given by the city, and annually ran for on
the same day to the present time. A bell was a common prize. A little
golden bell was the reward of victory in 1607 at the races near York;
whence came the proverb, for success of any kind, <i>to bear the
bell</i>."&mdash;<i>Pennant's Tour through Wales</i>, vol. <span class="smcap-all">I.</span> pp. 253, 254, 255, 256,

head, surmounted by the arms and coronet, into a marble bason beneath.
It is surmounted by a figure of Minerva, bearing a medallion containing
the busts of Lord Aylesbury and his countess, with three figures, one
supporting the medallion, one as a river god, and the third blowing the
trumpet of fame. The following is the inscription:&mdash;"<i>Cette fontaine a
